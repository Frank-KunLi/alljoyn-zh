<h1 id="system-design">System Design</h1>
<h2 id="overview">Overview</h2>
<p>The goal of the Security 2.0 feature is to allow an application to validate
access to interfaces or objects based on policies installed by the owner.  This
feature is part of the AllJoyn Core library.  It is not an option for the
application to enforce permission.  It is up to the user to dictate how the
application performs based on the access control lists (ACLs) defined for the
application.  The AllJoyn Core Permission component does all the enforcement
including the concept of mutual or one-way authorization before any message
action can be taken.</p>
<p>The Security Manager is a service that helps the user with key management and
permission rules building.  Using the application manifest template defined by
the application developer, the Security Manager builds the manifest consisting
of access control lists to let the end-user authorize which interactions the
application can do.  An application developer does not have to build a security
manager.  The permission can be installed by another application or another
security manager.</p>
<p>In addition to the encrypted messaging (using AES CCM) between the peers, the
Security 2.0 Permission module manages a database of access credentials and the
Access Control Lists (ACLs).</p>

<h2 id="typical-operations">Typical operations</h2>
<p>The following subsections describe the typical operations performed by a user.</p>
<h3 id="assumptions">Assumptions</h3>
<p>In all the flows listed in this section, the Security Manager is assumed to be
claimed by another Security Manager or to be self-claimed.  The certificates may
have been issued from sources in the cloud.  As the result, the Security Manager
is shown with one certificate authority and an identity certificate.</p>
<h3 id="sample-certificates-and-policy-entries">Sample Certificates and Policy Entries</h3>
<p>The following is a high level presentation of certificates and policy entries
used in the flows in this section.</p>

<p><strong>Figure:</strong> Sample Certificates and ACL entries</p>
<h4 id="the-peer-types">The peer types</h4>
<p>The following peer types are supported in the permission policy.  A peer may match many of the peer types.</p>
<table>
<thead>
<tr>
<th>Peer Type</th>
<th>Description</th>
</tr>
</thead>
<tbody>
<tr>
<td>ALL</td>
<td>This matches all peers including an anonymous peer using ECDHE_NULL key exchange.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>ANY_TRUSTED</td>
<td>This matches any authenticated peer for all authentication methods except ECDHE_NULL key exchange.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>FROM_CERTIFICATE_AUTHORITY</td>
<td>This matches any peer authenticated via ECDHE_ECDSA key exchange and its identity certificate’s trust is verified against the specific certificate authority listed in the policy for this type of peer.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>WITH_PUBLIC_KEY</td>
<td>This matches a peer with the specific public key.  The peer is authenticated via ECDHE_ECDSA key exchange.  Its identity certificate’s trust is verified against any of the application’s certificate authorities (including the security group authorities).</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>WITH_MEMBERSHIP</td>
<td><p>This matches any peer with possession of a membership certificate with the specific security group ID.</p><p>The peer is authenticated via ECDHE_ECDSA key exchange.  Its identity certificate’s trust is verified against any of the application’s certificate authority (including the security group authorities).</p><p>The subject of the membership certificate must be the peer’s public key.</p></td>
</tr>
</tbody>
</table>
<h3 id="define-a-security-group">Define a security group</h3>
<p>Any user can define a security group (logical grouping of applications and
users) using a Security Manager. When the user specifies a security group name
(for display purpose), the Security Manager creates the security group ID
(a GUID value).</p>
<h3 id="required-key-exchanges">Required Key Exchanges</h3>
<p>The framework requires either ECHDE_NULL or ECDHE_PSK key exchange for the claim
process.  Once the application is claimed, only the ECDHE_ECDSA key exchange is
allowed unless the policy allows for anonymous user; in such case, ECDHE_NULL is
acceptable.</p>
<h3 id="certificate-exchange-during-session-establishment">Certificate exchange during session establishment</h3>
<p>During the AllJoyn ECHDE_ECDSA key exchange and session establishment, the peers
exchange identity certificates, manifests, and all membership certificates.
Since all the membership certificates are exchanged, there is a potential
information disclosure vulnerability.  It is desired to have a more intelligent
selection algorithm to provide membership certificates on demand and need-to-know
basis.  This algorithm needs to take into account the latency of the certificate
exchange during the method call invocation.</p>
<p>The bus attachment trusts the peer if the issuer of the peer’s identity
certificate is any of its certificate authorities and any of the security group
authorities listed in the application’s policy.</p>
<p>After the session key is generated, the peers exchange all the membership
certificates.  Each membership certificate’s trust is checked against the
public key of the authority of the security group.</p>
<p><img alt="exchange-manifest-and-membership-certificates" src="../../../../files/learn/security2_0/exchange-manifest-and-membership-certificates.png" /></p>
<p><strong>Figure:</strong> Exchange manifest and membership certificates</p>
<p>The identity certificate chain is exchanged during the ECDHE_ECDSA key exchange
process.  The org.alljoyn.Bus.Peer.Authentication interface is not enforced with
permission.</p>
<h3 id="claim-a-factory-reset-application">Claim a factory-reset application</h3>
<p>Using a Security Manager any user can claim any factory-reset application. The
factory-reset application is assumed to be already onboarded to the network.  It
is recommended the claiming process occurs during the onboarding process while
the peers are connected via the SoftAP.</p>
<p><img alt="recommend-to-claim-during-onboarding" src="../../../../files/learn/security2_0/recommend-to-claim-during-onboarding.png" /></p>
<p><strong>Figure:</strong> Recommend to claim during onboarding</p>
<p>Claiming is a first-come, first-claim action. The user installs an admin
security group.  The procedure to make the application to become claimable again
is manufacturer-specific.   See the FactoryReset() in the Configuration
interface.  There will be an API call that allows the application to make itself
claimable again.</p>
<h4 id="claim-factory-reset-application-without-out-of-band-registration-data">Claim factory-reset application without out-of-band registration data</h4>
<p><img alt="claim-a-factory-reset-device-without-out-of-band-registration-data" src="../../../../files/learn/security2_0/claim-a-factory-reset-device-without-out-of-band-registration-data.png" /></p>

<p>The identity certificate will be used for authentication in the ECDHE_ECDSA key
exchange.</p>
<h4 id="claim-factory-reset-application-using-out-of-band-registration-data">Claim factory-reset application using out-of-band registration data</h4>
<p>An application manufacturer can provision a key or the application can
dynamically generate a key to support the claiming process. The ECDHE_PSK key
exchange is used in this scenario. The key is provided to the user out of band.
An example is a QR code or a token delivered via email or text messaging. The
user is prompted for the key when establishing a connection with the
factory-reset application.</p>
<p><img alt="claiming-a-factory-reset-device-using-out-of-band-registratin-data" src="../../../../files/learn/security2_0/claiming-a-factory-reset-device-using-out-of-band-registratin-data.png" /></p>
<p><strong>Figure:</strong> Claiming a factory-reset application using out-of-band registration
data</p>
<h3 id="example-of-building-a-policy">Example of building a policy</h3>
<p>A user uses a Security Manager application to build a policy. The Security
Manager application queries the About data and manifest templates from the
application. The Security Manager application can do further introspection of
the application for the detailed information of securable interfaces and secured
objects, and prompt the user to select the permissions to include in the policy.</p>
<p>A policy may contain a number of ACLs.  Please refer to section
<a href="#policy-acl-format">(Policy ACL format)</a> for more information.</p>
<h3 id="install-a-policy">Install a policy</h3>
<p>An admin can install a policy for the application.</p>
<p>When a policy is installed, the core framework may expire master secrets
including existing session keys if it is not able to apply the new policy without
re-authenticating the peer.  Resource constrained devices are most likely to
expire master secrets.  Expiring keys will cause existing sessions to terminate.</p>
<p><img alt="install-a-policy" src="../../../../files/learn/security2_0/install-a-policy.png" /></p>
<p><strong>Figure:</strong> Install a policy</p>
<h3 id="update-a-manifest">Update a manifest</h3>
<p>An admin can update a manifest for the application.  This involves resigning the
identity certificate because the new digest of the manifest must be included in
the identity certificate.</p>
<p><img alt="update-manifest" src="../../../../files/learn/security2_0/update-manifest.png" /></p>
<p><strong>Figure:</strong> Update manifest</p>
<h3 id="add-an-application-to-a-security-group">Add an application to a security group</h3>
<p>An admin issues a membership certificate with the given security group ID and

<h4 id="introduction_1">Introduction</h4>
<p>The AllJoyn security 2.0 ecosystem consists of many applications and devices.
Those applications and devices are deployed in various setups and for them it is
impossible to know up front what other peers they will see around them let alone
know how they should interact with them. Which peers can be trusted, which
rights do those peers have… So after being deployed, applications and devices
have to be configured. The people in charge of configuring the system, the
administrators need a service for this. Such a service is called a security
manager.</p>
<p>Depending on your setup, you need a different service. A large enterprise has
different requirements than a home does. Not all administrators have a strong
technical background. A tool for home users should have a straightforward,
understandable user interface (hiding the more complex features). These
simplifications should be done inside the security manager, so it is transparent
for applications and devices in which setup they are deployed. Application
developers should make no distinction between enterprise and small home.</p>
<p>A security configuration consists of two parts:
1. Certificates: certificates provide proof that an application is managed by a
   security manager. They can be used to gain access to resources of other peers
   or to provide resources themselves to others. The certificates describe the
   rights the subject has.
2. Policy: A policy is a list of Access Control Lists (ACLs). These ACLs
   describe how other peers can access the holder of the policy.</p>
<p>Security managers use AllJoyn to transfer this configuration to applications and
devices they manage.</p>
<h4 id="security-manager-architecture">Security Manager Architecture</h4>
<p>A security manager is a service that can take multiple forms. For a home setup
it can be a single application accessed by one person. For an enterprise setup,
multiple administrators need to use it, so its core can run on a server, with
some local application talking to it. When discussing the functional blocks of
the security manager, it is important to understand that those blocks can reside
on different machines and that for some of these we even have multiple instances.</p>
<ul>
<li>The manager provides certificates. In order to generate and sign certificates,
  it needs to have a certificate authority (CA).</li>
<li>Configuration storage: The security manager should keep track of what the
  configuration looks like. To do so, it should persist the configuration data.</li>
<li>UI: The administrator needs to interact with the security manager in order to
  make configuration changes. The user interface doesn't need to be part of the
  manager itself. It could be running in a web browser or it could offer a REST
  API, so that custom UI can be built on top.</li>
<li>AllJoyn Agent (security manager agent): Configuration updates are sent using
  AllJoyn as the communication protocol. The agent is the component which does
  the interaction with the managed peers.</li>
</ul>
<p>The following assumptions are made:
<em> The four functional blocks of the security manager can be combined into a
  single application, but it should be possible to run them in different
  applications or even on different hosts.
</em> A security manager can have multiple security manager agents acting on its
  behalf.
<em> The security manager topology is transparent for AllJoyn applications.
</em> A security manager is identified by the public key of its CA. We call this the
  key of the security manager.</p>
<p>The Alliance envisions multiple implementations of security managers and does
not provide implementation specifications. The Alliance does specify a set of
interfaces that allow the security managers to interact with AllJoyn security 2.0
based applications and devices.</p>
<h4 id="what-the-security-manager-manages">What the Security Manager manages</h4>
<p>We already mentioned a number of times that a security manager manages
applications and devices. But what does it mean and do we really manage
applications and devices? The security manager agent will use AllJoyn security
features to set up a secure connection to a peer. The only way it has to
securely identify this peer is by looking at that peer's public key. Since we
hand out certificates granting rights to this key, in fact it means we are
managing keys. So when asking what are we managing, we should ask ourselves who
has access to a key? There is no easy answer to this questions. It all depends
on the OS and platform the software is running on.</p>
<ul>
<li>On a plain Linux or Windows machine, applications can choose to protect data
  on a per-user basis, making it hard to protect the key from other applications
  running as the same user. On the other hand, the key is also not
  application-specific. When the same application runs as a different user, it
  can't access the key anymore.</li>
<li>Operating systems on smartphone do a better job at sandboxing applications.
  The link between key and application is stronger there.</li>
</ul>
<p>How many keys you need per device depends on the device:
<em> A single-function device (e.g., a temperature sensor) is considered as one big
  application. One key to do all operations.
</em> Every app on a smartphone is considered as an app on its own, so one key per
  application.
* The built-in firmware of a smart TV is also considered as a single app.
  Applications installed on top of the firmware of the TV are separate apps and
  should have their own key.</p>
<h5 id="what-we-can-trust">What we can trust</h5>
<p>The AllSeen Alliance offers a software stack that runs on top of some hardware
within an OS. The stack can be embedded in an application which is installed on
a device or could be integrated in a firmware of a device. The security manager
cannot distinguish this. He only sees a remote peer. Furthermore the security
manager cannot assume applications are running on trustworthy systems. If an
application runs on a compromised or malicious system, there is little we can do
inside the app to protect.  A genuine application running on malicious system,
should be treated as malicious. We should protect the ecosystem by:</p>
<ol>
<li>Being able to revoke the rights granted to an application.</li>
<li>Make sure compromised or even malicious applications are limited to rights
   they were given. Since we can't trust the OS or hardware the application is
   running on, these checks must be done at the remote peer side.</li>
</ol>
<p>The protective measure should be defined so that a well-behaving app on a well
behaving system can protect itself from any unwarranted access. If both peers
are malicious, then there is little we can do. But then they don't need AllSeen
to perform malicious acts. There is a risk though that 2 malicious applications
team up. Each individual app gets a small acceptable set of rights, but then
combining their rights to launch an attack.</p>
<p>When claiming an application two considerations must be made:</p>
<ol>
<li>Can I trust the application?</li>
<li>Can I trust the device where the application is running on? But not only the
   device and its OS, but for desktops systems as well which other applications
   are there? These apps might to try get access to the keystore of the genuine
   app. This is not something we can fix within the AllSeen Alliance. This
   remains an integration aspect</li>
</ol>
<h5 id="sharing-keystores">Sharing Keystores</h5>
<p>When an application is claimed, it will store its certificates inside a keystore.
This keystore can be shared. The security manager nor the system can prevent
applications from doing this. Is it recommended to share keystores? It has the
advantage that you only have to claim one application, while multiple
applications can use it. However the certificates in the store will only grant a
limited set of permission to its users. Sharing the store only makes sense if it
was granted all permissions required by its applications. Sharing keystore can
be allowed if the applications granted access to it are known upfront and the
union of rights is known.</p>
<p>Sharing keystores does have some side effects.  Every app using the keystore
will appear as the same manageable application. The security will be able to
manage one keystore via multiple apps. This feature requires additional layer of
complexity in order to provide the concurrent access to the shared keystore.</p>
<p>We also partially lose the ability to sandbox applications, as applications
using a shared keystore get a full set of rights linked to the store and not
necessarily the ones they strictly need.</p>
<h5 id="applications-integrated-in-firmware">Applications integrated in firmware</h5>
<p>The firmware of a device could consist of multiple smaller AllSeen applications.
From end-user perspective you only want to claim this device once. Those
applications are allowed to share their keystore, but only one of them should
provide the Security interfaces. So only one application is seen from security
manager perspective. When expressing the permission required for this
application, it should request all permissions required by the apps on that
device.</p>
<h5 id="standalone-applications">Standalone applications</h5>
<p>Standalone applications are apps downloaded and installed on a desktop computer,
tablet or smart phone or something similar. Standalone applications should not
share their  keystore with other applications. If such an application is built
out of separate sub-applications (each of them uses a separate bus attachment),
then they should follow the same rules as applications integrated in firmware.</p>
<h4 id="security-manager-operations">Security Manager Operations</h4>
<p>The security manager allows the following operations:
- security group management: create, update and delete security groups
    - allow grouping of applications. A group is uniquely defined by GUID and
      the public key of a security manager. Applications can become members of a
      group when they are issued a membership certificate for that group
- identity management: create, update and delete identities
    - Identities are used to define the users of application. Users can map to
      physical persons.  Applications can act on behalf of a user when they
      receive an identity certificate for that user’s security manager.  An
      application keystore should only have one identity certificate.
- application/key management:
    - claim applications: make it managed by this security manager
    - manage application manifest
    - manage AllJoyn certificates for these applications
    - manage policy (ACL's) of applications
    - force application to become un-managed again</p>
<h4 id="inter-security-manager-interaction">Inter Security Manager Interaction</h4>
<p>When applications interact with each other, they check if the interaction is
allowed by their policies as previously set by their security manager. In
practice, a peer must present a certificate (chain) signed by its security
manager public key. Meaning that with the basic features we created silos, you
can only talk to applications managed by your own security manager. In practice
applications managed by different security managers need to interact with each
other as well. We provide 2 ways to do this: Delegation and Restricted User.</p>
<h5 id="delegation">Delegation</h5>
<h6 id="use-case">Use case</h6>
<p>I’m the administrator of my home ecosystem. I claim appliances in the home and
provide them with configuration. I as administrator am the only person having
access to the security manager. When my kids want to get access to an appliance,
then they have to ask me to get approval for each application they want to use.
This may not be sufficient for all use cases. With delegation, my security
manager gives a membership certificate with delegation rights to the security
manager of each of my kids. With this certificate, they can delegate these
rights to their applications. They only need to ask one time and then they can
make any of their applications part of my group. Even though my kids did not
interact directly with each other, with these delegated certificates they
interact with each other in the scope of this group.</p>
<h6 id="limitations">Limitations</h6>
<p>The followings are the limitations of using delegation.
- You can only authenticate members of the group. Mutual authenticated requests
  can only be done between members of the group.
- My kids get Remote-control rights for the TV by giving them a membership
  certificate with delegation rights for my TV Group. Their remote control
  applications become members of the TV group. If I give my TV a policy for the
  TV group, then the TV will allow the request from the remote control apps of
  my kids. This requires my kids to define an ANY-TRUSTED policy for TV
  operations for their apps. This is ok for TVs remote control operations. If
  mutual authentication is required, the TV must become member of the TV group
  as well.
- For a chat use case you need to know who is sending a message and to whom
  you’re sending messages. So mutual authentication is required, and all
  participants have to be in that group.
- As policy is defined on group level, it would require separate groups in order
  to differentiate between kids and parents.</p>
<h6 id="delegating-certificate-flow">Delegating certificate Flow</h6>
<p>In the X.509 membership and identity certificates, the delegate concept is
represented by the basicConstraints extension cA flag.  If a grantee receives a
certificate with the X.509 basicConstraints extension cA flag equal to true, the
grantee can issue a certificate to others.  If the cA flag is false then a peer validating a
certificate chain verifies that no further delegation has been done, or the
chain is considered invalid.</p>
<p><img alt="reissue-membership-certificate" src="../../../../files/learn/security2_0/reissue-membership-certificate.png" /></p>
<p><strong>Figure:</strong> Reissue membership certificate</p>
<h5 id="restricted-access-for-other-security-manager">Restricted access for other security manager</h5>
<p>Restricted access tries to address the same problem as delegation but takes a
different approach to solve it. With delegation, you give a certificate to an
application. With that certificate the application can prove it is allowed
access to a group. With restricted access we define a policy on our managed
applications that allows applications from a different security manager to get
access. This would be as if we would pre-install the delegated membership
certificate on all our managed applications. So when the peer comes around, he
doesn't need to send the proof, the application already has it. Since policy
comes from a trusted source, we don't need to distribute certificates, we can
define a more compact ACL.</p>
<p>In practice, the security manager defines a restricted peer type for all
applications that need to interact with the applications of the peer security
manager. This ACL restricts applications of that security manager to a specific
set of rules. Those applications just need to prove that they are owned with an
identity certificate verifiable with the peer security manager certificate
authority. That authority is installed with the restricted peer entry into the
local application policy.</p>
<p>As example use case: Suppose we have a real-estate agent. When showing a house
to clients, he'd like to show-off the AllSeen-enabled home automation system.
This can be achieved with either delegation or restricted user. The advantage of
restricted user is that if he potentially needs to show 100 homes, he can do it
based on 1 certificate instead of 100 for the delegation scenario. There is less
risk for information disclosure. If someone could get hold of the 100
certificates, then he can learn who the home sellers are. In the restricted user
case, the seller's public keys are in the policy of the agent's app and policy
is never shared.</p>
<h6 id="install-a-restricted-peer-acl-flow">Install a restricted peer ACL Flow</h6>
<p>The admin installs a FROM_CERTIFICATE_AUTHORITY ACL into his local application’s
policy to allow his friend to have access to the local application.</p>
<p><img alt="add-restricted-user-rules-to-an-application" src="../../../../files/learn/security2_0/add-restricted-user-rules-to-an-application.png" /></p>
<p><strong>Figure:</strong> Add restricted user rules to an application</p>
<h3 id="application-manifest">Application Manifest</h3>
<p>When considering where AllSeen enabled applications will run, smartphones are an
obvious target. A lot of applications are available in various app stores.
Unfortunately not all of these applications are trustworthy. For example, the
flashlight app asks for access to phonebook, network, etc. Same as the
application is sandboxed on the smartphone, we would like to sandbox
applications within the AllSeen security 2.0 context. If I install an AllSeen TV
remote control app, then I would like it only to have rights to do TV
operations. Nothing more. Since we can't trust the application, we can't assume
it will behave properly. So these restrictions must be enforced by the peers.
For the remote control example, the TV must check whether the app has
permissions. When remote control app tries to open the door, then the door must
reject the call.</p>
<p>The main goal of an application manifest is to inform an admin which interfaces
an application will produce and consume. Once the admin accepts the manifest,
the manifest is signed and installed on the application. The signed manifest
will be used to enforce that the application cannot produce or consume any
unwarranted interfaces.</p>
<p>A signed application manifest limits the potential interfaces a malicious
application can access within a set of well-behaving applications.</p>
<p>The application manifest has a similar goal as an application manifest on an app
store application, in which an end-user has to accept a list of permissions when
installing a new application on his phone which are enforced by the app store
application framework. The implementation is however different, as described
below.</p>
<h5 id="requirements">Requirements</h5>
<h6 id="manifest-format">Manifest Format</h6>
<p>The manifest must be expressed at the interface level. It may be expressed at
the member level, but this is not recommended as this increases the complexity
that needs to be handled by the admin.</p>
<h5 id="manifest-acceptance">Manifest Acceptance</h5>
<p>The manifest template must be presented to the admin in a user-friendly way. As
the interface names might not be very informative, they must be mapped to a
user-friendly description.</p>
<p>As a malicious application can by definition not be trusted, the descriptions
must be provided by a trustworthy source.</p>
<p>The descriptions of the interfaces should be localized to the admin.</p>
<p>The AllSeen Alliance must provide descriptions for any standard AllSeen
interface, as reviewed and recommended by the Interface Review Board (IRB).</p>
<p>The application developer must provide the descriptions of any application
specific interfaces.</p>
<p>If a manifest template is defined at the member level, a description for each
listed member must be available.</p>
<h5 id="manifest-enforcement">Manifest Enforcement</h5>
<p>The accepted manifest must be enforced by the peer application, as a malicious
application may not be trusted to enforce it locally.</p>
<h5 id="manifest-update">Manifest Update</h5>
<p>Whenever an application is updated and does not require additional rights, it
may still use the previously signed manifest. Only when the update requires
additional rights, the application changes its state and signal the change to
let the admin know about the existence of a new manifest template.  The admin
can generate a new manifest for that application.</p>
<h5 id="implementation-scenario">Implementation Scenario</h5>
<p>This section describes the steps to generate the application manifest.  Once the
manifest is accepted,  its contents digest will be encoded in a new identity
certificate.</p>
<ol>
<li>The security manager discovers the remote application through the
   NotifyConfig signal.</li>
<li>The security manager retrieves the manifest template of the application.</li>
<li>Using the manifest template, the security manager starts the manifest
   building process.</li>
<li>The security manager contacts a server via HTTPS to retrieve the human
   readable description of the interfaces and presents them to the admin.  Note
   that the HTTPS server location is not yet defined.</li>
<li>The admin accepts (or rejects) the description of the manifest. When the
   admin rejects the manifest, the application will not receive a manifest.</li>
<li>The security manager reissues a new identity certificate with the digest of
   the requested (&amp; accepted) permissions.</li>
<li>The security manager installs the new identity certificate and manifest on
   the application.</li>
</ol>
<p><img alt="building-policy-using-manifest" src="../../../../files/learn/security2_0/building-policy-using-manifest.png" /></p>
<p><strong>Figure:</strong> Building Policy using manifest</p>
<h5 id="application">Application</h5>
<p>The application developer needs to embed the manifest template in his
application. There should be a platform specific callback function to retrieve
the manifest template that belongs to an application. For app store
applications, it could be based on convention, providing the manifest template
as a file inside the application package. For small embedded devices, the
manifest template could be part of the application.</p>
<p>To ease the generation of membership certificates by the security manager, the
manifest format is the same format that is used to express access rules in the
membership certificates.</p>
<h5 id="interface-description-server">Interface Description Server</h5>
<p>The server serving the descriptions of the interfaces can either be:
1. Hosted by the application developer for application specific interfaces. To
   prevent spoofing attacks, this server must be contacted via HTTPS and its URL
   must be based on the reverse domain name of the interface name.
2. Hosted by the AllSeen Alliance for common AllSeen interfaces. This server
   MUST be contacted over HTTPS.  Howeer, the URL for this server is not yet
   defined.</p>
<h5 id="manifest-enforcement_1">Manifest Enforcement</h5>
<p>When applying the specific policy rules, the remote peer will enforce the rules
specified in the manifest since the manifest is associated with the identity
certificate.</p>

<h3 id="anonymous-session">Anonymous session</h3>
<p>In scenarios when there is no trust established between two peers such as when a

<p>Note that ANY_TRUSTED includes only authenticated peers while ALL includes
unauthenticated (anonymous) peers.</p>
<p>Accessing secured interfaces, the consumer always use ECDHE_ECDSA to contact a
peer.  If the key exchange fails, it can fallback to ECDHE_NULL and contact the
peer as an anonymous user.  This process is automated so the application
developer does not need to drive the key exchange process.</p>

<p>Whenever an encrypted message is created or received, the access control rules
are searched for matching rules.  In order for a rule to be considered a match,
it must meet the following criteria:
- Be in an access control list matching peer type, public key,
and/or Security Group ID as specified for the ACL
- Match message header data based object path, interface name and member
name as specified for the rule.
- Match the action mask and not be an explicit deny.</p>
<p>Or the rule must match the following criteria:

- The ACL's key must match the public key of the peer
- The action mask must be an explicit deny.
- All other criteris (object path, interface and member names) must be *</p>
<p>The resulting set of matched rules is applied to the message as follows:
- If any explicit deny rule matches per above then the message is denied.
- If no deny rules match, then the message is allowed if at least one allow
rule matches.
- Otherwise, the message is denied.</p>
<h2 id="certificates">Certificates</h2>
<p>The following subsections detail the supported certificates.  The certificate
format is X.509 v3.  The certificate lifetime will be considered in order to
avoid having to revoke the certificate.  However, certain devices do not have
access to a trusted real time clock.  In such cases, applications on those
devices will not be able to validate the certificate lifetime.</p>
<h3 id="certificate-chain-validation">Certificate Chain validation</h3>
<p>Identity and membership certificate chains will be validated per section 6.1 of
RFC 5280 with the following additions, limitations and notes:
- The leaf certificate must have exactly one EKU and it must be the correct EKU
per the use case.  Certificates used for ECDHE_ECDSA authentication must
have the identity certificate EKU and certificates exchanged to indicate
security group memberships must have the membership certificate EKU.
- Intermediate certificates must have zero, one or both identity and membership
EKUs.
- No EKU will be treated as any EKU, per RFC 5280. EKU validation is transitive,
meaning any certificate with no EKU will inherit those of its parent.
- Time of validity will only be evaluated if the peer has a time source.
- The implementation will assume system time is trusted if available.
- For identity certificates, the associated digest of the leaf certificate
is validated against the digest of the manifest.
- The AKI is validated to not be null.
- CRL check is not implemented as there is no CRL.
- basicConstraints::pathLenConstraint will NOT be checked.</p>
<p>Certificate chains will be validated...
- When a certificate is received during claiming.
- When a certificate is installed.
- When a certificate is received during ECDHE_ECDSA authentication.
- When a certificate is received to assert security group membership.</p>
<h3 id="261-main-certificate-structure">2.6.1 Main Certificate Structure</h3>

<h3 id="recommended-best-practices-for-certificates">Recommended Best Practices for Certificates</h3>
<ul>
<li>Root certificates should include only the ExtendedKeyUsage OIDs for purposes
for which it will issue certificates.  Currently, these are the AllJoyn
identity and membership OIDs listed in this document.  Issuing root certificates
with no ExtendedKeyUsage extension or with the anyExtendedKeyUsage OID is
not recommended.  Adopting this practice will limit the potential abuse of
AllJoyn root certificates for unrelated purposes.</li>

<h2 id="application-state-announcement">Application State Announcement</h2>
<p>The Permission module provides a session-less signal to allow the Security
Manager discovering the applications to claim or to distribute updated policy or
certificates.  The current features provided by the About session-less signal
does not fulfill the Security Manager discovery requirement.  The signal
provides the following information:
1. A number field named state to show the state of the application.  The possible values of this field are:
    - 0 -- Not claimable.  The application is not claimed and not accepting
      claim requests.
    - 1 – Claimable.  The application is not claimed, but is accepting claim
      requests.
    - 2 – Claimed.  The application is claimed and can be configured.
    - 3 – Needs update.  The application is claimed, but requires a
      configuration update (after a software update).
2. The public key</p>
<p>This signal is emitted when
1. The bus attachment is enabled with peer security using ECDHE key exchanges
2. The application is claimed or do a factory reset
3. The application has a new manifest template</p>

<h3 id="certificate-revocation-not-fully-designed">Certificate revocation (not fully designed)</h3>
<p>The application will validate the certificate using a revocation service
provided by the Security Manager.  The revocation service is a distributed
service.</p>
<p>The Certificate Revocation Service is expected to provide a method call that
takes in the certificate and return whether the given certificate is revoked.</p>
<p>The application looks in its installed policy for the peer that provides the
Certificate Revocation Service.  If the application can’t locate any of the
Certificate Revocation Service, the certificate revocation check will be
skipped.</p>
<p>If a membership certificate is revoked, all signed authorization data related to
the membership certificate is no longer valid.</p>
<h4 id="current-work-around">Current work-around</h4>
<p>The admin can blacklist a peer by installing a deny rule in the application

<h3 id="distribution-of-policy-updates-and-membership-certificates-not-fully-designed">Distribution of policy updates and membership certificates (not fully designed)</h3>
<p>The Distribution Service is a service provided by a Security Manager.  This
service provides persistent storage and high availability to distribute updates
to applications.</p>
<p>An admin uses the Security Manager to generate updated policy and membership
certificates, encrypt the payload with a session key derived from a nonce value
and the master secret for the <sender, recipient> pair.  The package including
the sender public key, recipient public key, nonce, and encrypted payload is
sent to the Distribution Service to delivery to the recipient.  The recipient
uses the information in the package to locate the master secret to generate the
corresponding session key to decrypt the payload.  Once the decryption is
successful, the recipient signs the hash of the package and provide the
signature in the reply.</p>
