                <h1 id="sessionless-signal">Sessionless Signal</h1>
<h2 id="overview">Overview</h2>
<p>The sessionless signal is an AllJoyn&trade; feature that enables 
broadcasting of signals to all reachable nodes in the AllJoyn 
proximal network. This is different than the session-based signals 
described in <a href="../../../../learn/core/system-description/data-exchange">Data Exchange</a>, where signals are sent 
only to participants connected over a given session or 
multiple sessions (for session broadcast signals) based on 
sessionId/destination based routing. </p>
<p>Sessionless signals are logically broadcast signals and any 
app on the AllJoyn proximal network interested in receiving 
sessionless signals will receive all sessionless signals sent 
by any other app on that network. The AllJoyn system design 
refers to sessionless signals as logically broadcast because 
signals themselves are not broadcast/multicast, only an indication 
for signals is sent over multicast to all the nodes on the network. 
Applications do not have to be connected over sessions to receive 
sessionless signals, however, the AllJoyn router underneath 
must establish a session to fetch these signals based on the 
indication received. Applications can specify match rules 
(via AddMatch) to receive a specific set of sessionless 
signals and the AllJoyn router filters out signals based 
on those match rules. </p>
<p>The following figure captures the high-level architecture 
for the sessionless signal on the provider and consumer sides. 
The AllJoyn router supports a logical SLS module that implements 
sessionless signal logic. The SLS module makes use of the 
Name Service to advertise and discover sessionless signals 
using a sessionless signal-specific well-known name.</p>
<p><img alt="sls-arch" src="../../../../files/learn/system-desc/sls-arch.png" /></p>
<p><strong>Figure:</strong> Sessionless signal architecture</p>
<p>After AllJoyn router startup, the SLS module executes the 
following steps to prepare itself for sending and/or receiving 
sessionless signals. </p>
<ol>
<li>Create an object implementing "org.alljoyn.sl" interface 
which is the interface used between two AllJoyn routers to 
exchange sessionless signals.</li>
<li>Register signal handlers to receive signals from "org.alljoyn.sl" interface.</li>
<li>Bind a well-known sessionless signal session port 100 
to support incoming requests to fetch sessionless signals. </li>
</ol>
<p>The consumer app interested in receiving sessionless signals 
registers a match rule with the AllJoyn router to receive 
sessionless signals. As a result, the SLS module initiates 
discovery for sessionless providers via the Name Service 
(either the legacy Name Service or NGNS based on the router version). </p>
<p>On the provider side, the app sends a sessionless signal to 
the AllJoyn router. The SLS module stores the signal in a 
local message cache. The provider side sessionless signal 
generates a sessionless signal-specific well-known name 
and advertises that over AllJoyn network. </p>
<p>Upon discovering the sessionless signal provider, the consumer 
AllJoyn router establishes a session with the provider side 
AllJoyn router over the well-known session port for sessionless 
signals. Once the session is established, the consumer SLS module 
fetches sessionless signals via the org.alljoyn.sl interface. </p>
<p>The following sections detail the provider and consumer 
sessionless signal-related behavior.</p>
<h3 id="sessionless-signal-enhancement-in-the-1406-release">Sessionless signal enhancement in the 14.06 release</h3>
<p>Prior to the 14.06 release, the consumer side SLS module 
provides the functionality of requesting sessionless signals 
by matching certain filtering criteria specified by the AddMatch 
rule. The consumer fetches sessionless signals from all the 
providers and applies the AddMatch rules to filter received 
sessionless signals before passing these to interested applications.</p>
<p>The sessionless signal design in the 14.06 release was 
enhanced to enable a consumer application to request sessionless 
signals from provider applications supporting certain AllJoyn 
interfaces. For example, a Lighting Controller app can request 
Announcement sessionless signals only from those provider apps 
that implement the org.alljoyn.LightBulb interface. </p>
<p>The following key sessionless signal enhancements made to 
achieve this functionality:</p>
<ul>
<li>The sessionless signal advertised name was enhanced to add 
<INTERFACE> information from the header of the sessionless signal. 
Consumers use this to fetch sessionless signals only from those 
providers that are emitting signals from <INTERFACE> specified 
in the consumer side match rules. Multiple sessionless signal 
names are advertised, one for each unique interface in the 
sessionless signal cache.</li>
<li>The match rule definition for AddMatch has been extended to 
add a new 'implements' key that can be used to indicate the 
desire to receive the Announcement sessionless signal only 
from applications implementing certain AllJoyn interfaces as 
specified in the application's Announcement signal.</li>
</ul>
<p>Sessionless signals are only fetched from those providers 
that support interface details specified in the match rules. 
The AddMatch match rules are passed to the providers to 
filter signals based on those match rules. </p>
<h2 id="sessionless-signal-end-to-end-logic">Sessionless signal end-to-end logic</h2>
<p>The sessionless signal end-to-end logic consists of the 
following aspects, which are detailed in the sections below.</p>
<ul>
<li>The provider caches signals and advertises the availability of signals.</li>
<li>The consumer discovers sessionless signal providers.</li>
<li>The consumer fetches sessionless signals from a provider.</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="provider-caches-signals-and-advertises-availability">Provider caches signals and advertises availability</h3>
<p>On the provider side, the app sends a signal to the AllJoyn 
router with the SESSIONLESS flag set. The SLS module in the 
provider inserts the signal into its sessionless signal cache. 
The cache entry uses the combination of (SENDER, INTERFACE, MEMBER, 
and PATH) header fields of the signal as the key.  </p>
<p>Subsequent sessionless signals sent to the AllJoyn router 
with the same (SENDER, INTERFACE, MEMBER, and PATH) header 
fields overwrite the already cached sessionless signal.</p>
<p>The provider AllJoyn router assigns a change_id for sessionless 
signals. The change_id is used to indicate updates to sessionless 
signals to consumers on the AllJoyn network. Each sessionless 
signal cache entry includes (SLS signal, change_id) tuple. 
The change_id is incremented by the provider only after a new 
signal is inserted into its cache and a consumer has requested 
signals from the provider since the last time the change_id was incremented.</p>
<p>The app may remove an entry from the provider's cache by calling 
the CancelSessionlessMessage method of the org.alljoyn.Bus 
interface of the /org/alljoyn/Bus object. The entry being 
removed is specified by the serial number of the signal. 
The change_id is not incremented when the provider removes 
a signal from its cache. The contents of the cache, including 
the associated change_ids, determine what the provider will advertise.  </p>
<p>Prior to the AllJoyn 14.06 release, the SLS module requests 
and advertises the following sessionless signal well-known name: </p>
<ul>
<li>"org.alljoyn.sl.x<GUID>.x<change_id>"</li>
</ul>
<p>where:</p>
<ul>
<li>GUID is the GUID of the AllJoyn router</li>
<li>change_id is the maximum change_id in the sessionless signal cache.</li>
</ul>
<p>Starting with the AllJoyn 14.06 release, the SLS module 
requests and advertises the following sessionless signal well-known names:</p>
<ul>
<li>"org.alljoyn.sl.y<GUID>.x<change_id>"</li>
</ul>
<p>where:</p>
<ul>
<li>GUID is the GUID of the AllJoyn router</li>
<li>
<p>change_id is the maximum change_id in the SLS cache.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>"<INTERFACE>.sl.y<GUID>.x<change_id>"</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>where:</p>
<ul>
<li>INTERFACE is the value of the INTERFACE header field of the signal</li>
<li>GUID is the GUID of the AllJoyn router</li>
<li>change_id is the maximum change_id for signals in the 
    sessionless signal cache having the same value of the 
    INTERFACE header field.  </li>
</ul>
<p>At most, one well-known name is requested and advertised 
  for each unique INTERFACE header field value in the sessionless signal cache.</p>
<p>The following figure shows the provider side SLS module logic 
prior to the AllJoyn 14.06 release.</p>

<p><strong>Figure:</strong> Provider SLS module logic (introduced in the AllJoyn 14.06 release)</p>
<h3 id="consumer-discovers-sessionless-signal-providers">Consumer discovers sessionless signal providers</h3>
<p>On the consumer side, the app registers an interest in a 
sessionless signal by calling the D-Bus AddMatch method.</p>
<p><strong>NOTE:</strong> The D-Bus AddMatch method is part of the org.freedesktop. 
The D-Bus interface and is implemented by the /org/freedesktop/DBus object.</p>
<p>The match rule includes "sessionless='t'" to indicate registration 
for a sessionless signal, along with any other key/value pairs for 
filtering signals.  </p>
<p>Prior to the AllJoyn 14.06 release, the SLS module starts the 
name-based discovery process to discover the SLS WKN prefix 
"org.alljoyn.sl." after receiving the first sessionless 
match rule. When the last match rule is removed by an app 
connected to the AllJoyn router, the SLS module cancels 
discovering the SLS WKN prefix.</p>
<p>Starting with the AllJoyn 14.06 release, the sessionless 
signal logic on the consumer side was enhanced to enable 
an application requesting sessionless signals from providers 
implementing certain AllJoyn interfaces. A new 'implements' 
key was added to the AddMatch method to achieve this. 
The 'implements' key specifies an AllJoyn interface that 
should be implemented by the sessionless signal provider. 
Multiple 'implements' key/value pairs may be specified in 
a single match rule. These are treated as a logical AND 
when discovering sessionless signal providers. In the current 
implementation, the 'implements' key is only applicable for 
receiving the Announcement sessionless signal. An AddMatch 
that includes the 'implements' key should always include 
"interface= org.alljoyn.About".</p>
<p>The following figure shows the consumer logic for discovering 
sessionless signal providers implemented in the 14.06 release.</p>
<p><img alt="consumer-logic-sessionless-providers-1406" src="../../../../files/learn/system-desc/consumer-logic-sessionless-providers-1406.png" /></p>
<p><strong>Figure:</strong> Consumer logic for discovering sessionless providers (introduced in the AllJoyn 14.06 release)</p>
<p>If the AddMatch includes the 'interface' key but no 'implements' 
key, the SLS module performs name-based discovery to discover 
the name prefix "<interface>.sl." for the specified interface 
in the match rule.</p>
<p>If the AddMatch includes one or more 'implements' keys, the 
SLS module performs interface name discovery via the NGNS 
to discover providers implementing interfaces specified by 
the 'implements' key. The SLS module also performs a name-based 
discovery for name prefix "org.alljoyn.sl." both via mDNS 
and using the WHO-HAS message. The latter is intended to 
discover any sessionless signal providers prior to the 14.06 
release. Name-based discovery over mDNS is performed to catch 
unsolicited mDNS responses from providers for new/updated 
sessionless signals.</p>
<p>The app unregisters interest in a sessionless signal by 
calling the RemoveMatch method with a previously added 
match rule. When the last sessionless signal match rule is 
removed, the SLS module stops sessionless signal-related 
discovery, including both name-based and interface name discovery. </p>
<h3 id="consumer-fetches-sessionless-signals-from-a-provider">Consumer fetches sessionless signals from a provider</h3>
<p>After discovering a provider, the consumer SLS module 
determines if it needs to fetch sessionless signals from 
the provider based on the consumer's match rules and the 
change_id of the provider in the advertisement. The consumer 
SLS module keeps track of last acquired change_id for every 
provider GUID it has discovered via the sessionless signal 
advertised name. The sessionless signal fetch logic and the 
state maintained by the consumer for each provider was modified 
in the 14.06 release. The fetch logic functionality differences 
are described below.</p>
<ul>
<li>Prior to the 14.06 release, the consumer SLS module maintains 
the List<Provider GUID, last acquired change_id> information 
for discovered providers. The consumer SLS module fetch sessionless 
signals if an updated change_id is received from the provider 
as part of the sessionless signal advertised name.</li>
<li>Starting with the 14.06 release, multiple sessionless signal 
advertised names can be received from a given provider. 
In addition, the associated change_id can be different for 
each of those sessionless signal advertised names. The consumer 
SLS module maintains the List<Provider GUID, SLS name, change_id> 
for discovered providers. It also keeps track of the match rules 
that have been applied for a given provider. </li>
</ul>
<p>The following figure captures the consumer sessionless signal 
fetch logic implemented in the 14.06 release.</p>
<p><img alt="consumer-logic-sls-fetch-1406" src="../../../../files/learn/system-desc/consumer-logic-sls-fetch-1406.png" /></p>
<p><strong>Figure:</strong> Consumer logic to determine sessionless signal fetch (introduced in the 14.06 release)</p>
<p>The consumer SLS module receives the sessionless signal 
advertised name from a provider. The sessionless signal 
name can be received via multiple means:</p>
<ul>
<li>Solicited mDNS response over unicast as a result of an mDNS query</li>
<li>Unsolicited mDNS response over multicast</li>
<li>IS-AT multicast message (solicited or unsolicited). </li>
</ul>
<p>The consumer checks if any new match rules have been added 
after the last fetch from the provider or the received change_id 
in the sessionless signal name is greater than what was fetched 
previously from that provider.  </p>
<p>If either condition is true, the consumer initiates a sessionless 
signal fetch from a legacy provider (prior to the 14.06 release) 
without further checks. This is determined by examining the GUID 
segment of the sessionless signal advertised name received from the provider: </p>
<ul>
<li>Prior to the 14.06 release, the GUID is prefixed with an "x".</li>
<li>Starting with the 14.06 release, GUID is prefixed with a "y". </li>
</ul>
<p>If the sessionless signal name is from a 14.06 release or 
later provider, the consumer performs further checks to determine 
if the sessionless signal fetch should be done with the provider. </p>
<p>Starting with the 14.06 release, the sessionless signal name 
also includes the interface value from the sessionless signal 
header. In this case, the consumer SLS module checks whether 
the interface specified (if any) in the match rule is the same 
as the interface received in the sessionless signal name. </p>
<ul>
<li>If yes, the consumer initiates a sessionless signal fetch 
with the provider. </li>
<li>If no interface was specified in the match rule, the consumer 
initiates a sessionless signal fetch anyway because this 
constitutes a wildcard match. </li>
</ul>
<p>In the 14.06 release, a new RequestRangeMatch() signal is 
defined as part of the org.alljoyn.sl interface. This signal 
is used to fetch a set of sessionless signals that matches 
any of the match rules specified in the RequestRangeMatch()
signal. The consumer SLS module uses this signal to fetch 
sessionless signals from the 14.06 providers. </p>
<p><strong>NOTE:</strong> The current implementation does a catchup fetch for 
new match rules before fetching new signals for updated 
change_id. This results in two fetches upon receiving the 
sessionless signal advertised name, however, this would be 
a rare occurrence because adding a new match rule and 
receiving a sessionless signal advertised name typically 
does not occur at the same time.</p>
<p>Whenever a new AddMatch rule is added for sessionless signals, 
the consumer SLS module triggers a catchup fetch with already 
known providers for the new match rule per the logic captured 
in <a href="#consumer-fetches-sessionless-signals-from-a-provider">Consumer fetches sessionless signals from a provider</a>. For a catchup fetch, the 
RequestRangeMatch signal only includes the new match rule. 
If the new AddMatch includes an 'implements' key, the consumer 
SLS module performs discovery for providers implementing those interfaces.</p>
<p>The consumer schedules a sessionless signal fetch immediately 
for sessionless signal advertised names received in the 
solicited mDNS or IS-AT response messages. For sessionless signal 
advertised names received as part of the unsolicited mDNS or IS-AT 
response messages, the sessionless signal fetch is scheduled 
following a backoff algorithm as described in 
<a href="#sessionless-signal-fetch-backoff-algorithm">Sessionless signal fetch backoff algorithm</a>. </p>
<p>The steps to fetch sessionless signals follow.</p>
<ol>
<li>The consumer SLS module joins a session with the sessionless 
signal advertised name and known SLS port (port=100). </li>
<li>The consumer sends one of the signals defined in the 
org.alljoyn.sl (<code>RequestSignals()</code>, <code>RequestRange()</code>, or <code>RequestRangeMatch()</code>)<br />
to the provider over established session to fetch sessionless signals. </li>
<li>The provider receives the request signal, sends the requested 
sessionless signals and leaves the session.  </li>
</ol>
<p>For details of which signals the provider sends from its cache 
to the consumer, see the definition of these signals in 
<a href="#org-alljoyn-sl-interface">org.alljoyn.sl interface</a>. </p>
<p>The consumer receives the sessionless signals, and filters and 
routes them according to its match rules. The consumer SLS module 
maintains the information about the match rules applied and change_id 
fetched from the provider for future sessionless signal fetches.</p>
<h4 id="sessionless-signal-fetch-backoff-algorithm">Sessionless signal fetch backoff algorithm</h4>
<p>After determining that it needs to fetch sessionless signals 
from a given provider as per the logic described above, the 
consumer SLS module attempts a join session with the producer 
to fetch sessionless signals. If the consumer's first join session 
attempt fails, it follows a backoff based retry logic to do 
the join session for the sessionless signal fetch from the 
provider. The SLS fetch logic adds random delays at different 
consumers to ensure that consumer requests for sessionless 
signals fetch are distributed over time for a given provider. </p>
<p>The Consumer SLS module follows a mix of linear plus exponential 
backoff retries for sessionless signals fetch. It supports a 
hybrid of first few linear backoff retries followed by some 
exponential backoff retries. The transition point between the
linear and exponential backoff is configurable. The backoff 
interval is capped off to a maximum configurable value. 
Retries are performed for a total retry period R. Once the 
max backoff interval is reached, retries continue with the 
constant retry period (set to max backoff interval) until the
total retry period R is elapsed.</p>
<p>The following configuration parameters have been added in 
the router config file:
<em> Linear to Exponential Transition Point (k) - Specifies the 
retry attempt after which backoff should become exponential.
</em> Max Backoff Interval Factor (c) - Specifies the multiplication 
factor for T (initial backoff time) to generate the max backoff interval.
* Total Retry Period (R) - Specifies the total time period (in seconds) 
for which SLS fetch retry must be attempted.</p>
<p>The following figure shows an example SLS retry schedule with 
SLS retries happening at T, 2T, 3T, 4T, 8T, 16T, 32T, 32T, 32T,....</p>
<p><img alt="sls-fetch-backoff-schedule-example" src="../../../../files/learn/system-desc/sls-fetch-backoff-schedule-example.png" /></p>
<p><strong>Figure:</strong> SLS fetch backoff schedule example</p>
<p>For every SLS retry attempt, the join session with the producer 
is delayed randomly between [0, retry interval] to make sure 
Consumer requests are distributed over time. For example in 
the figure above:
<em> The Consumer join session for 4th SLS fetch retry 
will be randomly delayed between [0, 4T] interval. 
</em> The Consumer join session for nth SLS fetch retry will 
be randomly delayed between [0,16T] interval.</p>
<p>For the SLS fetch triggered as a result of solicited mDNS 
discovery responses, the join session request is not delayed 
randomly. In this case, the join session for SLS fetch is 
done immediately. The AllJoyn router will serialize such an SLS 
fetch if the max connections limit on the Consumer is reached.</p>
<h2 id="sessionless-signal-message-sequences-prior-to-the-1406-release">Sessionless signal message sequences (prior to the 14.06 release)</h2>
<p>Since the sessionless logic has changed quite a bit in the 
14.06 release, separate SLS message sequences are captured 
prior to the 14.06 release and starting from the 14.06 release.  </p>
<p>The following use cases detail sessionless signal logic 
scenarios prior to the 14.06 release:</p>
<ul>
<li>First sessionless signal delivery</li>
<li>Another AddMatch done by the same app</li>
<li>Another app requests sessionless signals</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="first-sessionless-signal-delivery">First sessionless signal delivery</h3>
<p>The following figure shows the message flow for the use 
case for sending and receiving the first sessionless signal 
on the provider and consumer, respectively.</p>
<p><strong>NOTE:</strong> The sessionless signal change_id is not carried in any 
of the sessionless signal messages. However, the provider 
AllJoyn router logic ensures that it only sends sessionless 
signal messages up to the change_id that was discovered by 
the consumer. When the JoinSession is done by the consumer, 
it uses the sessionless signal well-known name discovered 
from the IS-AT message. The change_id included in that well-known 
name provides the upper limit for the change_id for sending 
sessionless signals to the consumer. </p>
<p>A similar message flow is applicable for the use case when a 
subsequent sessionless signal is delivered. The main difference 
is that the provider updates the change_id, if applicable, as

<p><strong>Figure:</strong> First sessionless signal delivery</p>
<p>The message flow steps are described below.</p>
<ol>
<li>Both provider and consumer apps connect to the AllJoyn 
router, and a unique name is assigned to the app endpoint 
by the AllJoyn router.</li>
<li>The provider app registers its service object implementing 
an interface containing signal member with the AllJoyn core library. </li>
<li>The consumer app registers a signal handler for the 
sessionless signal by invoking the AllJoyn core library's 
<code>RegisterSignalHandler</code> API.</li>
<li>The consumer app invokes AllJoyn core library's <code>AddMatch</code> 
API to add a rule for receiving sessionless signals. The API 
specifies a signal match rule with type='signal', sessionless='t' 
and other applicable parameters. </li>
<li>The AllJoyn core library invokes the AllJoyn router's AddMatch 
method to add the sessionless signal filtering rule at the AllJoyn router.</li>
<li>The consumer AllJoyn router invokes <code>FindAdvertisedName()</code> 
with the sessionless SLS WKN prefix "org.alljoyn.sl" to discover 
providers offering sessionless signals.</li>
<li>The consumer AllJoyn router sends a WHO-HAS message for 
"org.alljoyn.sl" prefix.</li>
<li>The provider app has a sessionless signal to send. 
It invokes the BusObject Signal(...) call which generates an 
AllJoyn SIGNAL message with the sessionless flag set to true.</li>
<li>The SIGNAL message is sent from the app to the AllJoyn router. </li>
<li>The provider AllJoyn router stores the signal in the sessionless 
signal cache and assigns a new sessionless signal change_id number.</li>
<li>The provider AllJoyn router generates a well-known name 
for the sessionless signal with the latest change_id using 
the format org.alljoyn.sl.x<GUID>.x<change_id>.</li>
<li>The provider AllJoyn router does a RequestName for this 
well-known name to reserve this name. It then calls the 
<code>AdvertiseName</code> method to advertise this name on the AllJoyn network. </li>
<li>The provider AllJoyn router sends out an IS-AT message 
with the generated sessionless signal well-known name.</li>
<li>The consumer AllJoyn router receives the IS-AT message 
that passes the prefix matching for "org.alljoyn.sl". 
A FoundAdvertisedName signal gets generated for the the 
sessionless signal prefix.</li>
<li>The consumer AllJoyn router compares its current change_id 
for the AllJoyn router GUID in the IS-AT message with the 
change_id received in the IS-AT message. It determines that 
the received change_id is different than the current change_id 
and it needs to get the new set of sessionless signals from 
the provider AllJoyn router.</li>
<li>The consumer AllJoyn router invokes the <code>JoinSessionAsync</code> 
method to start a session with the provider AllJoyn router. 
It specifies the sessionless signal wel-known name and the 
sessionless session port among other parameters.
  This initiates a session attachment flow at the AllJoyn router 
  level between the consumer and provider. </li>
<li>Once the session is established, the consumer AllJoyn router 
sends a RequestSignals signal to request the latest set of 
sessionless signals from the provider app. This signal includes 
the last acquired change_id for the GUID of provider AllJoyn router.</li>
<li>The provider AllJoyn router sends SIGNAL messages for all 
sessionless signals added after the change_id provided in the 
RequestSignals message. The SIGNAL messages have destination 
as local endpoint of the consumer AllJoyn router. </li>
<li>Once all SIGNAL messages have been sent, the provider 
AllJoyn router initiates a LeaveSession method for the connected 
session. This triggers sending a DetachSession SIGNAL message 
to the consumer AllJoyn router. </li>
<li>After receiving the DetachSession signal, the consumer 
AllJoyn router knows that it has received all new sessionless 
signals from the provider AllJoyn router. It then updates 
its change_id for that GUID to the latest received change_id 
from the IS_AT message. </li>
<li>The consumer AllJoyn router filters the received sessionless 
signal messages based on the registered AddMatch rules for 
the sessionless signals.</li>
<li>The consumer AllJoyn router sends SIGNAL messages to the 
AllJoyn core library via callback. The AllJoyn core library 
in turn calls the registered signal handler for the sessionless signal. </li>
</ol>
<h3 id="another-addmatch-done-by-the-app">Another AddMatch done by the app</h3>
<p>A consumer app might invoke a subsequent AddMatch call for 
sessionless signals. Prior to the 14.06 release, this is 
interpreted as adding another rule for filtering future received 
sessionless signals. </p>
<ul>
<li>At the AllJoyn router, any future received SLS messages 
will be filtered based on the combined set of match rules. </li>
<li>If there is a more restrictive rule which matches a small 
set of sessionless signals and there is another less restrictive 
rule which matches a larger superset of signals, AllJoyn router 
will always send larger superset of signals to the app. </li>
</ul>
<p><strong>NOTE:</strong> The AllJoyn router does not re-fetch sessionless signal 
messages associated with the existing change_id when a new match 
rule is added. The new match rule is applied to any future 
received messages. Starting with the 14.06 release, this behavior 
was modified and the SLS module initiates the sessionless signal 
fetch whenever any new match rule is added.</p>
<p>The following figure shows the message flow for the scenario 
where another AddMatch is done by the same app. Most of the steps 
are same as the first sessionless signal delivery. The main difference 
is that no FindAdvertisedName needs to be done for "org.alljoyn.sl" 
because discovery for the SLS WKN prefix was already initiated 
at the time of receiving first AddMatch for the sessionless 
signal and is already in progress.</p>

<p><strong>Figure:</strong> Another add match done by the app</p>
<h3 id="another-app-requesting-for-sessionless-signal">Another app requesting for sessionless signal</h3>
<p>For the use case where multiple apps are connected to a 
given AllJoyn router, each application can invoke the <code>AddMatch</code> 
call to add match rules for sessionless signals with the AllJoyn 
router. These AddMatch calls can be received at different times. 
When the first AddMatch call is received from an app, the AllJoyn 
router re-fetches the currently valid sessionless signals 
from the already discovered providers for sending to that app. 
The AllJoyn router uses the RequestRange signal to fetch the 
current set of sessionless signals.</p>
<p>The following figure shows the message flow for the scenario 
when a subsequent app performs the first AddMatch for sessionless signals.</p>
<p><img alt="another-app-requesting-sls" src="../../../../files/learn/system-desc/another-app-requesting-sls.png" /></p>

<h2 id="sessionless-signal-message-sequences-1406-release">Sessionless signal message sequences (14.06 release)</h2>
<p>In the 14.06 release, the sessionless signal logic was enhanced 
as described earlier. This section captures the sessionless 
signal message sequences with the enhanced logic. The following 
use cases are detailed:</p>
<ul>
<li>First sessionless signal delivery</li>
<li>Sessionless signal delivery between a new consumer and a legacy provider </li>
<li>Sessionless signal delivery between a legacy consumer and a new provider </li>
<li>Subsequent AddMatch done by an app</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="first-sessionless-signal-delivery_1">First sessionless signal delivery</h3>
<p>This use case defines when the first AddMatch is done by a 
consumer app to receive sessionless signals. The match rules 
specified in the AddMatch may or may not include the new 'implements' 
key. Both use cases are captured accordingly:</p>
<ul>
<li>AddMatch does not include 'implements' key</li>
<li>AddMatch includes 'implements' key</li>
</ul>
<h4 id="addmatch-does-not-include-implements-key">AddMatch does not include 'implements' key</h4>
<p>The following figure shows the message flow for sending and 
receiving the first sessionless signal for the use case when 
AddMatch does not include an 'implements' key/value pair.</p>
<p><img alt="first-sls-delivery-no-implements-addmatch" src="../../../../files/learn/system-desc/first-sls-delivery-no-implements-addmatch.png" /></p>
<p><strong>Figure:</strong> First sessionless signal delivery (no 'implements' key in AddMatch)</p>
<p>The message flow steps are described below.
1. Both the provider and consumer apps connect to the AllJoyn router.
2. The provider app registers its service object implementing 
an interface containing signal member with the AllJoyn core library. 
3. The consumer app registers a signal handler for the sessionless 
signal by invoking the AllJoyn core library's RegisterSignalHandler API.
4. The consumer app invokes the AllJoyn core library's 
AddMatch API to add a rule for receiving sessionless signals. 
The API specifies a signal match rule with type='signal', 
interface='<INTERFACE>', sessionless='t' and other applicable parameters. 
5. The AllJoyn core library invokes the AllJoyn router's 
AddMatch method to add the sessionless signal filtering 
rule at the AllJoyn router.
6. The consumer AllJoyn router invokes the <code>FindAdvertisedName</code> 
method with the SLS WKN prefix "org.alljoyn.sl." to discover 
providers prior to the 14.06 release and SLS WKN "<INTERFACE>sl." 
to discover new providers starting in the 14.06 release. 
7. The consumer AllJoyn router sends out name-based 
query messages using the NGNS.
8. The provider app has a sessionless signal to send. 
It invokes the <code>BusObject Signal(...)</code> call which generates 
an AllJoyn SIGNAL message with SESSIONLESS flag set to true.
9. The SIGNAL message is sent from app to the AllJoyn router. 
10. The provider AllJoyn router stores the signal in the sessionless signal cache.
11. The provider AllJoyn router generates the following:
   * A well-known name for the sessionless signal of the format 
   "org.alljoyn.sl.y<GUID>.x<change_id>" with the latest change_id. 
   * A second well-known name for the sessionless signal of 
   the format "<INTERFACE>.y<GUID>.x<change_id>" with the 
   latest change_id associated with signals generated 
   by the given <INTERFACE>.
12. The provider AllJoyn router invokes the RequestName 
and AdvertiseName method calls to request and advertise these names. 
13. The provider AllJoyn router sends out a Name Service 
response messages to advertise these sessionless signal 
well-known names using NGNS.
14. The consumer AllJoyn router receives the Name Service 
response messages which pass the prefix matching for "org.alljoyn.sl." 
or "<INTERFACE>.y<GUID>.x<change_id>". A FoundAdvertisedName 
signal gets generated for the advertisements.
15. The consumer determines that it needs to fetch sessionless 
signals from the provider, based on the received sessionless 
signal advertised name, change_id comparison, and current 
set of match rules as per logic described in <a href="#consumer-fetches-sessionless-signals-from-a-provider">Consumer fetches 
sessionless signals from a provider</a>. 
16. The consumer AllJoyn router invokes JoinSessionAsync 
method call to start a session with the provider AllJoyn router. 
It specifies the sessionless signal well-known name and 
sessionless session port among other parameters.
   This initiates a session attachment flow at the AllJoyn 
   router level between the consumer and provider. 
17. Once the session is established, the consumer AllJoyn 
router sends the RequestRangeMatch signal to request the 
latest set of sessionless signals from the provider device. 
This signal includes last acquired change_id for the GUID 
of provider AllJoyn router, and the match rules that have 
not yet been applied to the provider GUID.
18. The provider AllJoyn router sends the AllJoyn SIGNAL 
messages for all sessionless signals added that pass the 
match rules in the range provided in the RequestRangeMatch signal.
19. Once all SIGNAL messages have been sent, the provider 
AllJoyn router initiates LeaveSession for the connected session. 
This triggers sending a DetachSession SIGNAL message to the 
consumer AllJoyn router. 
20. After receiving the DetachSession signal, the consumer 
AllJoyn router knows that it has received all new sessionless 
signals from the provider AllJoyn router. It then updates its 
change_id for that GUID to the latest received change_id 
from the advertisement and also updates status for match 
rules which have been applied to that provider. 
21. The consumer AllJoyn router sends SIGNAL messages to the 
AllJoyn core library via callback. The AllJoyn core library 
in turn calls the registered signal handler for the sessionless signal. </p>
<h4 id="addmatch-includes-the-implements-key">AddMatch includes the 'implements' key</h4>
<p>The following figure shows the message flow for sending and 
receiving of the first sessionless signal for the use case 
when AddMatch includes one or more 'implements' key/value pair. </p>
<p><strong>NOTE:</strong> Currently, the 'implements' key only applies to the 
Announcement sessionless signal. As a result, the AddMatch 
in this case must include "interface=org.alljoyn.About", 
which is the interface that emits the Announcement signal.</p>
<p>The AllJoyn router initiates interface name discovery via 
NGNS to find providers which implements the specified interfaces. 
Once those providers are discovered, the consumer AllJoyn router 
fetches the Announcement signals from those providers.</p>

<h3 id="sessionless-signal-delivery-between-a-new-consumer-and-a-legacy-provider">Sessionless signal delivery between a new consumer and a legacy provider</h3>
<p>The following figure shows the message flow when a new consumer 
(14.06 release or later) received sessionless signals from a 
legacy provider (prior to the 14.06 release).</p>

<p>The following figure shows the message flow when a legacy consumer 
(prior to the 14.06 release) is receiving sessionless signals 
from a new provider (14.06 release or later).</p>

<h3 id="subsequent-addmatch-done-by-an-app">Subsequent AddMatch done by an app</h3>
<p>After the first AddMatch call to the AllJoyn router, applications 
can subsequently invoke other AddMatch calls to add more 
match rules for sessionless signals. </p>
<p>Starting from the 14.06 release, whenever an AddMatch call 
is invoked by any app, the SLS module takes steps to trigger 
fetch for sessionless signal messages. The logic is quite 
similar to the first sessionless signal delivery use case 
in <a href="#first-sessionless-signal-delivery">First sessionless signal delivery</a>. 
The additional step is to fetch sessionless signal messages 
from existing providers that match the specified filtering 
criteria for sessionless signals.</p>
<p>The consumer SLS module remembers the sessionless signal 
advertised name it has received from each provider. For the 
new AddMatch rule that doesn't include implements key, the 
consumer uses the match rule to find matching providers among 
existing providers and fetches sessionless signals from those providers.</p>
<p>The consumer SLS module performs the following steps.</p>
<ol>
<li>Perform interface name discovery for providers for 
any new 'implements' key/value pair specified in AddMatch. 
Fetch the sessionless signals from the discovered providers.</li>
<li>Perform name-based discovery for "<INTERFACE>.sl" for any 
new interface value specified in AddMatch, for which discovery 
was not already done. Fetch the sessionless signals from 
the discovered providers.</li>
<li>Fetch the sessionless signals from the already known providers 
if the sessionless signal name received from these providers 
match the filtering criteria specified in match rule.</li>
