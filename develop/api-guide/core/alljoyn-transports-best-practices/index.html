<h1 id="alljoyn-transports-best-practices">AllJoyn&trade; Transports Best Practices</h1>
<h2 id="introduction">Introduction</h2>
<p>Transports are based on ISO OSI layer 4 - transport layer - mechanisms.
Such transport mechanisms are typically optimized for some set
of operating characteristics or network environments. The resulting
optimizations and environments in the layer 4 transport mechanism
will result in different qualities being presented by AllJoyn Transports
that use them.</p>
<p>In order to be called an AllJoyn Transport, all Transports must provide
the same capabilities, however, since the underlying mechanisms provide
differencing amounts of support for various functions, some layer 4
transports, and therefore AllJoyn Transports will be more suitable
to some distributed applications.</p>
<p>This document discusses how to determine which AllJoyn Transports
might be more suitable than others to different application traffic
patterns and requirements.</p>
<h2 id="alljoyn-transports">AllJoyn Transports</h2>
<p>One of the fundamental abstractions in an AllJoyn system is that
of a Transport. An AllJoyn Transport provides an abstract
representation of a collection of underlying mechanisms
that provides four basic functions  :</p>
<ul>
<li>The ability to discover remote AllJoyn Bus Attachments or Interfaces</li>
<li>The ability to advertise local AllJoyn Bus Attachments to
the greater AllJoyn system</li>
<li>The ability to establish traffic flows to other AllJoyn devices</li>
<li>The ability to move AllJoyn Messages (representing Method Calls,
Method Replies or Signals) between devices.</li>
</ul>
<p>In the ISO OSI seven-layer model, the transport layer is
responsible for moving data sequences from one host to another
and maintaining appropriate transport-specific qualities of
service. One measure of quality of service, for example, is
reliable and ordered delivery of data. TCP and UDP both move
data sequences from one host to another, and have different
quality of service guarantees. TCP provides reliable, ordered
byte streams; and UDP provides datagram services with no
guarantee of ordering or reliable delivery. TCP and UDP are
thus both transport layer (layer 4) protocols in the ISO OSI model.</p>
<p>AllJoyn Transports make use of lower-level OS services like TCP
or UDP in order to manage the actual movement of data sequences,
and therefore sit above layer 4 in the OSI protocol stack.
Since the AllJoyn Transport manages underlying connections
on behalf of the application layer (layer 7) the concept of
AllJoyn Transport most closely matches the session layer
(layer 5) of the ISO OSI model.</p>
<h3 id="alljoyn-messaging">AllJoyn Messaging</h3>
<p>The AllJoyn Message layer, which is responsible for marshaling
and unmarshaling of Signals and Method Calls, can be thought
of as residing in the presentation layer (layer 6) of the ISO OSI model;
and the routing functionality of the AllJoyn Routing Node
can be thought of as lying above AllJoyn Transports (still in layer 5),
but below the Message layer at layer 6.</p>
<p>In the following figure, notice that the AllJoyn Bus Attachment
corresponds to the application layer in the seven-layer model
in that it provides the interface between the network stack
and the application itself. Bus Attachments provide functionality
required by the application to create, marshal and unmarshal
AllJoyn Messages. This functionality corresponds to translating
between application and network data formats and therefore
corresponds to the presentation layer in the seven-layer model.</p>
<p><img alt="alljoyn-osi-seven-layer-arch" src="../../../../files/develop/api-guide/core-bestpractices/alljoyn-osi-seven-layer-arch.png" /></p>
<p><strong>Figure:</strong> Mapping of AllJoyn system and OSI layer transports</p>
<p>AllJoyn Messages are sent to a local Routing Node which is
responsible for selecting an AllJoyn Transport over which
a given Message must be sent. AllJoyn Transports are responsible
for controlling the dialogs between computers and therefore
correspond to the session layer of the seven-layer model.
Messages are sent to an OSI transport layer mechanism,
for example TCP or UDP, with suitable guarantees of service.
The transport layer passes byte streams or datagrams to the
network layer   and then down to the 802.11 MAC and PHY
in the figure.</p>
<h3 id="supported-alljoyn-transports">Supported AllJoyn transports</h3>
<p>Since an AllJoyn Transport encapsulates the functions of
moving data sequences, connections, and advertisement and
discovery, there are separate AllJoyn Transports for separate
underlying mechanisms. For example, the AllJoyn TCP Transport
uses TCP/IP as the mechanism for moving data between Routing Nodes;
the AllJoyn UDP Transport uses UDP/IP as the mechanism; the
AllJoyn Bluetooth (BT) Transport does the same for Bluetooth
connections, and the AllJoyn Local Transport uses UNIX domain sockets.</p>
<p>Often, the name given to an AllJoyn Transport echoes the method
used in the underlying OSI layer 4 mechanism. For example, the
AllJoyn TCP transport uses TCP/IP to move bits from one host
to another; the AllJoyn UDP Transport uses UDP/IP to actually move bits.</p>
<p>AllJoyn applications may select the AllJoyn Transport that is
actually used by choosing one or more TransportMask bits in
appropriate AllJoyn APIs. The currently defined TransportMask
bits are listed in the following table.</p>

<p>Currently, the AllJoyn system's WLAN and LAN transports are
supported by a single underlying TCP transport.</p>
<h3 id="routing-node-transport">Routing node transport</h3>
<p>Each transport establishes and maintains connectivity based on
the underlying physical transport it supports. Based on the
type of underlying physical transport, the actual connectivity
between two routing nodes in an AllJoyn network can be either
single-hop or multi-hop. An AllJoyn distributed bus is an
overlay network whose topology does not necessarily map directly
to the topology of the underlying network. If an application
has no preference, it can provide TRANSPORT_ANY and allow the
AllJoyn system to determine which transport to use.</p>
<p>The most commonly used Routing Node-to-Routing Node transports
in the AllJoyn system are based on the IP family of transport
mechanisms: TCP/IP and UDP/IP. These ISO layer 3 and 4 mechanisms
are almost universally supported across the AllJoyn platforms
of interest. Although from a high-level perspective, they
accomplish the same objectives, at closer examination the
go about things slightly differently and therefore have different
strengths and weaknesses.</p>
<h4 id="tcp">TCP</h4>
<p>TCP and UDP are fairly complementary protocols, which is why
they are both present in the IP stack. TCP is a relatively
complicated connection-based protocol that allows applications
to send data reliably from one side to another. If data is
lost, it is retransmitted automatically by TCP. The transmitted
data is stream-based which means that it is sent and received
as a sequence of bytes that are arbitrarily (from the point
of view of the sender) broken up into network packets.
In order to operate over the wider Internet, streams of TCP data
are flow-controlled and TCP uses congestion-avoidance mechanisms
to prevent congestion collapse in the presence of (many) multiple streams.</p>
<h4 id="udp">UDP</h4>
<p>UDP, on the other hand, is a simple, high-speed "wrapper" around
the lower-level network layer (IP) functions provided to move data.
UDP is inherently connectionless and data is sent in so-called
datagrams which are discrete "packages". UDP is not a connection-based
protocol; nor does it provide any reliability guarantees. There is
no flow control nor is there congestion avoidance functionality present in UDP.</p>
<p>These low-level transport characteristics percolate up into the
corresponding AllJoyn Transports which take advantage of those
characteristics to more efficiently accomplish the goals of applications.</p>
<p>Since underlying layer 4 mechanisms can provide very different
qualities of service, one should infer that the choice of
AllJoyn TransportMask, and therefore Transport, can have significant
effects on the quality of service of an AllJoyn Message flow.
Making such choices effectively is the subject of the remainder
of this document.</p>
<h3 id="transportmask">TransportMask</h3>
<p>As shown in <a href="#alljoyn-transportmask-definition">AllJoyn TransportMask definition</a>,
a number of TransportMask-related symbols are defined as of
this writing. It is the case (for historical reasons) that although
they are associated with different bits, the symbols TRANSPORT_TCP,
TRANSPORT_WLAN, TRANSPORT_WWAN, TRANSPORT_LAN all refer to the
AllJoyn TCP Transport. It is recommended that only the symbols
TRANSPORT_TCP be used to refer to the AllJoyn TCP Transport in
order to minimize confusion. TRANSPORT_NONE is simply a constant
defined to be none of the transports, which isn't particularly useful.
The Wi-Fi Direct Transport (TRANSPORT_WFD) is not currently supported.
The implication is that only the following TransportMask definitions
should be used to refer to specific AllJoyn Transports:
<em> TRANSPORT_TCP
</em> TRANSPORT_UDP</p>
<p><strong>Recommendation 1</strong></p>
<blockquote>
<p><em>Do not refer specifically to transports that are present for
historical reasons such as TRANSPORT_WLAN, TRANSPORT_WWAN, or
TRANSPORT_LAN; neither refer to currently unsupported transports
such as TRNSPORT_WFD. Instead, prefer currently defined transports --
TRANSPORT_TCP or TRANSPORT_UDP.</em></p>
</blockquote>
<p>As mentioned above, symbols defining groups of transports are also provided:</p>
<ul>
<li>TRANSPORT_IP - Describes both TRANSPORT_TCP and TRANSPORT_UDP</li>
<li>TRANSPORT_ANY - Refers to all currently defined transports
that are not considered experimental.</li>
<li>TRANSPORT_ALL - It is not recommended to use TRANSPORT_ALL
unless there is a specific need to include all experimental
AllJoyn Transports.</li>
</ul>
<p>More typically, one would include specific experimental transports
on an as-needed basis.</p>
<p>If there is no need to select an AllJoyn Transport in order
to take advantage of some specific quality of service, one
would pass TRANSPORT_ANY to all advertisement-, discovery-
and session-related APIs. As a result, the AllJoyn Transport
selected by an AllJoyn application is on a first-discovered
basis. That is, the first advertisement that happens to be
received is the one that will drive the selection of transport.
Presumably this is fine since by selecting TRANSPORT_ANY both
the advertising and discovering Bus Attachment are effectively
declaring that "anything I discover is fine".</p>
<p><strong>Recommendation 2</strong></p>
<blockquote>
<p><em>If the primary concern of a distributed application is the
ability to connect, that is, when neither the client nor the
service side of a communicating pair of Bus Attachments has
any particular quality of service guarantee, prefer TRANSPORT_ANY
and simply join a Session to the Bus Attachment corresponding
to the first advertisement received.</em></p>
</blockquote>
<p>Depending on the availability of AllJoyn Transport, this choice
may result in the selection of a very high-speed IP-based Transport
such as TCP or UDP. It may also result in a communication link
over a personal area network connection which may be relatively slow.
Since the overriding goal is communication irrespective of
mechanism, such choices are presumed to be appropriate.</p>
<p>In order to make any more meaningful choices, one must understand
some of the qualities of the existing AllJoyn Transports
which might affect such a choice.</p>
<h3 id="homogeneous-multipoint-sessions">Homogeneous Multipoint Sessions</h3>
<p>One of the connectivity options in the AllJoyn system is that of a
multipoint Session.  This option allows clients to send AllJoyn
Messages to multiple destinations that are members of the Session.
It may be desirable to ensure that all members of a multipoint
Sesion be reachable over the same kind of transport.  This is
referred to as a homogeneous multipoint Session.</p>
<p>It is also the case that as of this writing (release 14.12) there
is a defect in the AllJoyn Routing Node code that causes problems
with heterogeneous multipoint sessions (mutipoint sessions with
members reached through different Transports).  If the system
happens to preferentially select different advertisements on
different hosts, using TRANSPORT_ANY could cause connectivity
problems.</p>
<p>Because of these situations, one should specify a single transport
type for multipoint sessions.</p>
<p><strong>Recommendation 3</strong></p>
<blockquote>
<p><em>Consider making a single explicit choice of transport when
using multipoint sessions to avoid different qualities of service
among session members and to work around a code defect in release
14.12 of the Routing Node.</em></p>
</blockquote>
<h2 id="alljoyn-tcp-transport">AllJoyn TCP Transport</h2>
<p>The AllJoyn system  provides a Transport based on the TCP/IP protocol.
TCP/IP is the workhorse of the current Internet, has a long history,
and works well over a very large range of links of it rates
and signal qualities.</p>
<p>TCP, defined by RFC-793, has been used extensively in many
disparate environments. From this, one can infer that since
TCP/IP is almost always a good choice for communicating over
the greater Internet, so the TCP Transport is almost always
a good choice for AllJoyn Transport mechanism.</p>
<p>It is worthwhile to understand, however, that while there
are a number of things that TCP is very good at, there are
also some things that TCP does not do well.</p>
<h3 id="advantages-to-using-tcp">Advantages to using TCP</h3>
<p>TCP/IP provides a connection-oriented, error-checked, ordered,
reliably delivered stream of bytes between communication endpoints.
This kind of stream is often called a flow, and corresponds
to the transmission mechanism underlying the concept of a
Session in the AllJoyn system.</p>
<p>The AllJoyn system converts Messages (Method Calls, Replies, Signals, etc.)
into a collection of bytes and passes them to TCP. In turn,
TCP takes the bytes that make up sequences of Messages and
breaks them up into whatever TCP considers to be the best-sided
"chunks" of data to send. TCP calls these chunks "segments"
and it is these segments that are sent to the IP layer.
Note that there is no necessary correlation between the
delimitation of TCP segments and AllJoyn Messages. These chunks
are delivered to the remote side of a connection, reorganized
into a stream of bytes and delivered to the AllJoyn system.
It is the stream of bytes that is delivered between AllJoyn
instances and there are no record markers inserted automatically
by TCP - TCP provides a byte stream service.</p>
<p>The upshot of this is that TCP is very good at moving streams
of bytes from one place to another over internetworks of
possibly dramatically differing and somewhat typically
asymmetric link speeds. TCP is typically configured by default
with quite large buffers allowing for high bandwidth-delay
products over the current Internet; but also provides flow
control to prevent a fast writer from overrunning a slow reader.
Basically, TCP is designed to be very good at transferring
large amounts of data; and it accomplishes this goal very well.
If the traffic pattern presented by a distributed application
presents as a sequence of very large AllJoyn Messages it
appears to the underlying system as a byte stream to be transferred.</p>
<p><strong>Recommendation 4</strong></p>
<blockquote>
<p><em>If the primary concern of a distributed application is the
ability to transfer large amounts of data reliably, prefer the
AllJoyn TCP Transport, and selectively join Sessions only to
Bus Attachments advertising over TRANSPORT_TCP.</em></p>
</blockquote>
<h3 id="disadvantages-to-using-tcp-reasons-to-use-udp">Disadvantages to using TCP (reasons to use UDP)</h3>
<p>In order to accommodate the wildly varying qualities of service
of the worldwide Internet, TCP is also quite aggressive about
trying to get data sent from one end to another. This means
that it will retry transmissions for quite a long time before
giving up. This can translate into a significant delay (13 minutes,
in many cases) before a Bus Attachment is notified of a link failure.
Link failure can happen frequently in mobile environments as
devices move from one access point to another, for example.</p>
<p>TCP does provide a keep-alive mechanism designed to mitigate
this problem, but support is platform-specific and spotty.
The AllJoyn system provides a layer 5 mechanism called LinikTimeout to
implement a device independent link failure detection mechanism.</p>
<p><strong>Recommendation 5</strong></p>
<blockquote>
<p><em>If using the TCP Transport, consider using the LinkTimeout
feature to quickly detect link failures; or consider the UDP Transport.</em></p>
</blockquote>
<p>The counterpoint to the observation about TCP trying very hard
to get data from one side of a connection to another is
exactly that. TCP tries many times over a long period of time
to get data to the remote host  . Thus, if the application
requires such intensive retry and can tolerate long delays
before links are declared down, TCP will be much more aggressive
in trying to get data across a link.</p>
<p><strong>Recommendation 6</strong></p>
<blockquote>
<p><em>If the primary concern of a distributed application is the
ability to move data reliably, prefer the AllJoyn TCP Transport
and do not set a LinkTimeout.</em></p>
</blockquote>
<p>To avoid congestion collapse of the greater internetwork,
TCP implements significant congestion control mechanisms
are used in TCP. These include slow-start, which begins transfers
slowly in order to avoid filling the internet "pipe" with data
which might be dropped due to congestion. Because slow-start
will delay use of full-bandwidth capabilities of the network,
intermittent or infrequent traffic patterns in which a device
is idle for a time, then sends a burst of data, and then goes
idle again may run afoul of slow-start. Since the AllJoyn
UDP Transport is designed to run only on local subnetworks,
it does not implement slow-start.</p>
<p><strong>Recommendation 7</strong></p>
<blockquote>
<p><em>If the traffic pattern of the distributed application
consists of bursts of significant amounts of data between
fairly extended periods of idling, consider using the UDP Transport
to avoid effects of TCP slow-start.</em></p>
</blockquote>
<p>There have been several additions to TCP to accommodate call-and-response
traffic patterns, such as delayed ACK and the Nagle algorithm.
Nonetheless, TCP is oriented toward transferring large amounts
of data. TCP is not very good at sending a small amount of data
and receiving a small amount of data in return - exactly the
kind of interactions typical of Remote Procedure Call; and the
AllJoyn system is, at its heart, an RPC system.</p>
<p><strong>Recommendation 8</strong></p>
<blockquote>
<p><em>If the traffic pattern of the distributed application
consists of Remote Procedure Calls, especially with call and
reply Messages of length less than 1480 bytes, consider using
the UDP Transport which is optimized for this kind of interaction.</em></p>
</blockquote>
<p>Since TCP is a reliable byte stream protocol, its whole reason
for being is to transfer all bytes from one end to another.
This is not always desirable. In a real-time system, it is
often the case that out-of-date data is worthless. Such
out-of-date data simply consumes network and host resources
unnecessarily. Since TCP simply transfers streams of bytes
reliably, there is no opportunity to drop worthless data once
it has been delivered to the system. The UDP Transport has
been optimized to allow AllJoyn Messages to be timestamped
and will drop the UDP datagrams that make up an AllJoyn Message
at any time the datagrams are found to be out of date.</p>
<p><strong>Recommendation 9</strong></p>
<blockquote>
<p><em>If the traffic pattern of the distributed application includes messages
with a finite Time to Live (TTL), consider using the UDP Transport
which provides significantly improved support for avoiding unnecessary
transmission of Messages with expired TTL.</em></p>
</blockquote>
<p>TCP provides a three-way handshake consisting of SYN, SYN+ACK,
and ACK segments. This TCP-specific messaging must complete
before any user data may be transferred. Since the AllJoyn system
is derived from D-Bus, and D-Bus requires a SASL authentication phase,
The AllJoyn system must implement a SASL exchange for D-Bus compatibility on
TCP. The AllJoyn system also requires its own handshake consisting of the
exchange of a BusHello Message and a HelloReply Reply message.
Thus, connection establishment using TCP requires the following:
<em> At least three packets be exchanged for TCP connection establishment
</em> Four packets for the SASL exchange and ACKs
* Four packets for BusHello, reply and ACK.</p>
<p>Additionally, TCP requires a four-way handshake for connection termination.</p>
<p>The UDP Transport uses much simplified signaling and, since
it is an AllJoyn-specific protocol, piggybacks AllJoyn session
establishment messages on top of the ARDP SYN and SYN+ACK exchanges.
Connection termination is handled in the UDP Transport at the
session layer, so only one or two packets are required for
connection termination - four or five packets of overhead,
as compared to eleven. At a round-trip delay of six milliseconds,
this can be a significant improvement.</p>
<p><strong>Recommendation 10</strong></p>
<blockquote>
<p><em>If the traffic pattern of the distributed application includes
frequent connection establishment and termination, consider
using the UDP Transport which requires significantly fewer
packets to establish and terminate connections.</em></p>
</blockquote>
<h2 id="alljoyn-udp-transport">AllJoyn UDP Transport</h2>
<h3 id="overview">Overview</h3>
<p>The AllJoyn system provides a Transport based on the UDP/IP protocol.
UDP is a very simple, datagram-oriented (packet-based) layer 4 protocol.
Each output operation by an application will produce one
datagram which, modulo fragmentation, is sent to the remote
destination   which receives it as one input operation.</p>
<p>Unlike TCP, UDP provides no guarantees of ordering or delivery.
Since AllJoyn Message streams do provide such guarantees,
a reliability layer must be provided to use UDP in the AllJoyn system.
The reliability and ordering guarantees are provided by the
AllJoyn Reliable Datagram Protocol (ARDP). Additionally,
ARDP provides the fragmentation mechanism required to send
maximal AllJoyn Messages (about 130 Kbytes) over UDP
which has a maximum datagram size of 64 Kbytes.</p>
<p><strong>NOTE:</strong> For more information about UDP, review RFC 768: User
Datagram Protocol and RFC 908: Reliable Data Protocol.</p>
<h3 id="advantages-to-using-udp">Advantages to using UDP</h3>
<p>The goal of the UDP Transport is to address the areas of
weakness that the TCP Transport presents when executing call
and response traffic patterns. The UDP Transport does not do
any kind of congestion control since it is expected to operate
only on directly connected subnetworks. It therefore does not
do slow-start and lost packets are not considered an indication
of congestion, which is not necessarily an appropriate inference
in wireless networks.</p>
<p><strong>Recommendation 11</strong></p>
<blockquote>
<p><em>If the environment in which applications are expected to be
deployed corresponds to communication over wireless physical
layers and communication is expected to be only on the directly
connected subnetwork, consider the UDP Transport.</em></p>
</blockquote>
<p>Since the UDP Transport is a packet-oriented transport, it is
possible to map AllJoyn Messages directly into packets.
This allows for selectively dropping the constituent packets
of a packet stream according to expired TTL. Since this selective
dropping of AllJoyn Messages cannot be done in TCP, when the
offered load of a network   exceeds its capabilities, the TCP Transport
tends to "back up" with the in-flight segments, all consisting
of data which will be ultimately dropped. In extreme cases,
the network can be completely congested with data that will
be discarded, the end result being no interesting (on-time)
data is transferred.</p>
<p><strong>Recommendation 12</strong></p>
<blockquote>
<p><em>If applications use the Time to Live (TTL) option in Messages,
consider the UDP Transport which provides a much improved ability
to drop non-interesting (not on-time) data.</em></p>
</blockquote>
<p>Since UDP Datagrams are not associated with specific sockets in
the BSD Sockets API, it is possible for a single socket to
support multiple ARDP connections. This corresponds to the
ability of multiple AllJoyn Sessions to run over a single socket.
It also turns out that File Descriptors must be allocated in
an AllJoyn Routing Node to handle events related to a Session
and communication endpoint management. Since both sockets,
and more generally file descriptors, are operating system
resources which may be limited, specifying the UDP Transport
can allow many more connections on a given host system.</p>
<p><strong>Recommendation 13</strong></p>
<blockquote>
<p><em>If socket or file descriptor resource usage is anticipated
to be a problem, consider specifying the UDP Transport which
uses fewer resources per connection than the TCP Transport.</em></p>
</blockquote>
<h2 id="tuning-the-tcp-transport">Tuning the TCP Transport</h2>
<p>Each system that provides a networking subsystem and TCP/IP
protocol suite usually presents a number of tunable parameters
for those subsystems. In Linux systems, these parameters are
typically accessed through the sysctl interface; in Windows,
there will be a number of corresponding Registry entries.
Operating system providers will initialize these various
parameters with values that provide good tradeoffs for the
systems and environments involved.</p>
<p>There is a wealth of information regarding tuning these network
and TCP parameters available on the Internet. We therefore will
not duplicate that information here. When tuning for the AllJoyn system,
remember that sequences of AllJoyn Messages are converted into
byte streams and ultimately sent to TCP/IP by the AllJoyn TCP Transport.
It is the linearized AllJoyn message stream that is the traffic
pattern to be optimized for.</p>
<p>It is a testament to TCP and the selection of these various
tuning parameters that the vast majority of system users will
not attempt to change the underlying TCP configuration. In most
cases, the system is left as-shipped and it will work sufficiently well.</p>
<p>Wireshark can provide valuable insights into the TCP messaging
that occurs in AllJoyn systems. The AllJoyn system has provided
a dissector to the Wireshark project which is now included in
the standard Wireshark distributions.</p>

It is the sequence of AllJoyn messages sent as datagrams that

<h3 id="socket-buffers">Socket buffers</h3>
<p>Since the vast majority of Internet traffic is sent over TCP,
tuning the UDP protocol has become somewhat of a second-order
problem. The socket buffers provided by default for UDP are
often quite small, on the order of 128 Kbytes. While this is
sufficient for many uses of UDP such as name services, it is
small when compared to the bandwidth-delay product of modern
Wi-Fi systems.</p>
<p><strong>NOTE:</strong> An 802.11n system using Modulation and Coding Scheme (MCS) 11
can run at 300 megabits per second. Given a round-trip time of
6 msec, this corresponds to a buffer size of 225 Kbytes.</p>
<p>One thing to keep in mind when considering buffer sizes for
the UDP Transport is that one socket may be shared by a number
of Sessions. The UDP Transport actually provides additional
buffering on a per-connection basis in order to accommodate
at least one maximally sized AllJoyn Message (about 130 Kbytes)</p>
<p>Wireshark can provide valuable insights into the UDP messaging
that occurs in AllJoyn systems. The AllJoyn system has provided
a dissector to the Wireshark project which is now included in
the standard Wireshark distributions.</p>
<h3 id="ardp-configuration">ARDP configuration</h3>
<p>Along with the UDP subsystem, the UDP Transport provides the
ARDP reliability layer (detailed in <a href="#overview">Overview</a>.
There are a number of configurable parameters corresponding
to ARDP, but two of those configuration items are of utmost
importance: SEGBMAX and SEGMAX.
<em> The SEGBMAX parameter sets the limit on how large of a
UDP Datagram that ARDP will use when fragmenting AllJoyn Messages.
</em> The SEGMAX parameter sets the number of datagrams that can be
in-transit at any time.</p>
<p>SEGBMAX can be thought of as corresponding loosely to the
Maximum Segment Size (MSS) of TCP and SEGMAX can be thought of
as corresponding to the receive window size.</p>
<p>Typically, the primary use case of the UDP Transport will be
to transfer relatively small RPC Messages and the corresponding
Message Reply. The SEGMAX and SEGBMAX parameters are irrelevant
if transferring messages and replies of less than 1480 bytes
since all data fits into one packet. However when transferring
larger amounts of data, it is possible to optimize ARDP in
ways that can make it significantly faster than TCP.</p>
<h3 id="tuning-scenario">Tuning scenario</h3>
<p>While the level of tuning described below will be rarely needed,
the scenario is provided for completeness and as an illustration
of how the UDP Transport works.</p>
<p><strong>NOTE:</strong> This analysis was done using the default network and
UDP protocol settings of the Linux system on which the experiments were run.</p>
<h4 id="segbmax-setting">SEGBMAX setting</h4>
<p>The following figure shows a sensitivity analysis for the
setting of SEGBMAX. The time measured on the y-axis is the
time to transfer a 10 megabyte file in maximal (130 Kbytes)
AllJoyn Messages.</p>
<p><img alt="segbmax-sensitivity-analysis" src="../../../../files/develop/api-guide/core-bestpractices/segbmax-sensitivity-analysis.png" /></p>
<p><strong>Figure:</strong> SEGBMAX sensitivity analysis</p>
<p>Since UDP is a user-level protocol, all acknowledgments must
be done at user privilege  , which implies a context switch
for each packet. If SEGMAX is chosen to be too small, or if
large amounts of data are sent in very small datagrams, much
time is spent simply context switching to ACK data - the system thrashes.
As SEGMAX approaches one packet (1480 byte payload) and moves
upward toward the maximum UDP Datagram size, the system spends
less and less time having to ACK individual smaller datagrams.
This tendency is counteracted, however, by the fact that as
UDP datagram size increases, the number of actual PHY packets
that must be resent in the presence of a datagram loss also
increases. These pressures tend to cancel each other out in
practice. In the data below, there is a local minimum at
SEGBMAX of 4400 bytes which represents the optimal choice
for the 54 Mbit per second Wi-Fi.</p>
<p>In the test runs shown in the SEGBMAX sensitivity analysis,
the combination of SEGBMAX and SEGMAX was held constant at
the minimal value required to accommodate a maximal AllJoyn Message.</p>
<h4 id="segmax-setting">SEGMAX setting</h4>
<p>The following figure shows a sensitivity analysis for SEGMAX
with SEGBMAX held constant at 4440 bytes.</p>
<p><img alt="segmax-sensitivity-analysis" src="../../../../files/develop/api-guide/core-bestpractices/segmax-sensitivity-analysis.png" /></p>
<p><strong>Figure:</strong> SEGMAX sensitivity analysis</p>
<p>The plot starts with SEGMAX at 31 and plots the time to
transfer a 10 megabyte file for each SEGMAX value. It can
be seen that there is an underlying step function that
jumps at SEGMAX values of 31, 62, and 93. These correspond
to the values at which one, two and three maximal AllJoyn Messages
can be buffered in the system. There is a significant gain
to double-buffering AllJoyn Messages at SEGMAX of 62 and
greater; and there is an incremental gain to triple-buffering
AllJoyn Messages at SEGMAX of 93.</p>
<p>Notice that the UDP Transport is slower than the TCP Transort
with single-buffering, slightly faster with double-buffering
and significantly (15-20%) faster with triple buffering.
Since there is no statistically significant improvement
past triple-buffering, a good choice of SEGBMAX and SEGMAX
can be shown to be SEGBMAX = 4440 bytes, and SEGMAX = 93 datagrams.
This is in fact the choice made as the default for the ARDP configuration.</p>
<p>It is possible that different systems could have specific
characteristics that change this analysis. For example, if the
UDP Transport is run on a host device for which context switch
time is much higher and the network much cleaner, the tradeoff
of context switch time versus network retransmission may be at
a different point. It is possible that different networking
environments may require more datagram buffering to fill the
in-transit data; or it may also be the case that triple-buffering
is overkill on much slower networks.</p>
<h2 id="conclusion">Conclusion</h2>
<p>As they are configured by default, both the UDP Transport
and the TCP Transport provide a level of service as defined
by the abstract notion of an AllJoyn Transport. Although
they both provide the same services, the characteristics of
the underlying transport mechanisms on which they are based percolate up.</p>
<p>Characteristics of underlying transports may be viewed as
either advantages or disadvantages depending on the applications
using them and the requirements of those applications. Specific
traffic patterns generated by distributed applications may
imply that the choice of one of the AllJoyn Transports can
provide significantly better levels of service than others.</p>
<p>It may also be the case that no specific choice of AllJoyn Transport
is actually the best choice. In such situations, the fact that
a connection, any connection, is possible overrides the qualities
of service possible from underlying transport mechanisms.</p>
<p>In any case, understanding the underlying traffic of a
distributed application and how AllJoyn Transports handle
that traffic allows for optimizing the distributed application behavior.</p></div>
