By using the AboutClient class, your\napplication is notified when AboutServer instances send\nannouncements.\n\n\nNOTE: Verify the BusAttachment has been created, started\nand connected before using an AboutClient. See \nSetting Up\nthe AllJoyn Framework\n for the code\nsnippets. Code in this section references a variable msgBus\n(the BusAttachment variable name).\n\n\nSetup to receive the Announce signal\n\n\nIn order to receive the Announce signal, implement a class\nthat inherits from the\nAnnounceHandler base class.\n\n\nCreate class to implement AnnounceHandler\n\n\nThis declaration of a class will allow for the signals to be\nreceived. It needs to implement pure virtual function Announce.\n\n\nclass AnnounceHandlerImpl : public ajn::services::AnnounceHandler (){\n   void Announce(unsigned short version, unsigned short port,\n      const char* busName, const ObjectDescriptions\n objectDescs,\n         const AboutData\n aboutData);\n}\n\n\n\n\nImplement the Announce method that handles the Announce signal\n\n\nWith everything linked up using the AllJoyn framework, the\nmethod registered with the AllJoyn framework will be executed\nupon receipt of an Announce signal.\n\n\nBecause every application is different, as a developer you\nwill need to process the\nAboutData and determine the following:\n\n\n\n\nHow in the UI it should be rendered\n\n\nWhen to request the data that is not contained in the Announce signal\n\n\nAny logic that is needed\n\n\n\n\nRegister the announceHandler using the AnnouncementRegistrar class\n\n\nWhen registering an announcement listener, specify which\ninterfaces the application is interested in. The code below\nshows a listener registered to receive Announce signals that\ninclude an object implementing the INTERFACE_NAME interface.\n\n\nAnnounceHandlerImpl* announceHandlerImpl = new AnnounceHandlerImpl();\nconst char* interfaces[] = { INTERFACE_NAME };\nAnnouncementRegistrar::RegisterAnnounceHandler(*busAttachment,\n   *announceHandlerImpl, interfaces, 1);\n\n\n\n\nUsing Ping to determine presence\n\n\nThe BusAttachment Ping member function can be used to determine\nif a device is responsive. Contents of an Announce signal can\nbe stale so it is recommended to ping the device to see if it\nis still present and responsive before attempting to form a connection.\n\n\nNOTE: The BusAttachment.Ping method makes a bus call. If \nPing\n\nis called inside an AllJoyn callback, \nBusAttachment.EnableConcurrentCallbacks\n\nmust be called first.\n\n\n// when pinging a remote bus wait a max of 5 seconds\n#define PING_WAIT_TIME  5000\nmsgBus-\nEnableConcurrentCallbacks();\n   QStatus status = msgBus-\nPing(busName.c_str(), PING_WAIT_TIME);\n   if( ER_OK == status) {\n   ...\n}\n\n\n\n\nRequest non-announced data\n\n\nIf there is a need to request information that is not contained\nin the announcement, perform the following steps.\n\n\n\n\nJoin the session\n\n\n\n\nCreate a session with the application by using the\n   BusAttachment JoinSession API.\n\n\nNOTE: The variables name and port are set from the AboutData\n   from the Announce method.\n\n\ncpp\n   SessionId sessionId;\n      SessionOpts opts(SessionOpts::TRAFFIC_MESSAGES, false,\n         SessionOpts::PROXIMITY_ANY, TRANSPORT_ANY);\n      QStatus status = msgBus-\nJoinSession(name, port, NULL, sessionId, opts);\n      if (status == ER_OK) {\n         QCC_DbgTrace((\"JoinSession SUCCESS (Session id=%d)\", sessionId));\n      } else {\n         QCC_LogError(status, (\"JoinSession failed\"));\n      }\n\n\n\n\nCreate AboutClient\n\n\n\n\nGenerate an AboutProxyBusObject from the org.alljoyn.About\n   Introspection XML and create an instance passing ButAttachment\n   and sessionId.\n\n\ncpp\n   AboutProxyBusObject * aboutClient = new AboutProxyBusObject\n      (msgBus, sender_name,\"\\About\", sessionId);\n   aboutClient-\nGetAboutData(\"\");\n\n\n\n\nCreate AboutIconClient\n\n\n\n\nGenerate an IconProxyBusObject from the org.alljoyn.Icon\n   Introspection XML and create an instance passing\n   ButAttachment, port, and sessionId.\n\n\ncpp\n   IconProxyBusObject * aboutIconClient = new IconProxyBusObject\n      (msgBus, sender_name, \"About\\DeviceIcon\", sessionId);\n   aboutIconClient-\nGetUrl();\n\n\nShutdown\n\n\nOnce you are done using the About feature and the AllJoyn\nframework, free the variables used in the application.\n\n\nNOTE: The AboutClient object must be deleted before the\nBusAttachment object.\n\n\ndelete aboutClient;\ndelete aboutIconClient;\ndelete msgBus;",

By using the AboutClient class, your\napplication is notified when AboutServer instances send\nannouncements.  NOTE: Verify the BusAttachment has been created, started\nand connected before using an AboutClient. See  Setting Up\nthe AllJoyn Framework  for the code\nsnippets. Code in this section references a variable msgBus\n(the BusAttachment variable name).  Setup to receive the Announce signal  In order to receive the Announce signal, implement a class\nthat inherits from the\nAnnounceHandler base class.  Create class to implement AnnounceHandler  This declaration of a class will allow for the signals to be\nreceived. It needs to implement pure virtual function Announce.  class AnnounceHandlerImpl : public ajn::services::AnnounceHandler (){\n   void Announce(unsigned short version, unsigned short port,\n      const char* busName, const ObjectDescriptions  objectDescs,\n         const AboutData  aboutData);\n}  Implement the Announce method that handles the Announce signal  With everything linked up using the AllJoyn framework, the\nmethod registered with the AllJoyn framework will be executed\nupon receipt of an Announce signal.  Because every application is different, as a developer you\nwill need to process the\nAboutData and determine the following:   How in the UI it should be rendered  When to request the data that is not contained in the Announce signal  Any logic that is needed   Register the announceHandler using the AnnouncementRegistrar class  When registering an announcement listener, specify which\ninterfaces the application is interested in. The code below\nshows a listener registered to receive Announce signals that\ninclude an object implementing the INTERFACE_NAME interface.

Contents of an Announce signal can\nbe stale so it is recommended to ping the device to see if it\nis still present and responsive before attempting to form a connection.  NOTE: The BusAttachment.Ping method makes a bus call. If  Ping \nis called inside an AllJoyn callback,  BusAttachment.EnableConcurrentCallbacks \nmust be called first.  // when pinging a remote bus wait a max of 5 seconds\n#define PING_WAIT_TIME  5000\nmsgBus- EnableConcurrentCallbacks();\n   QStatus status = msgBus- Ping(busName.c_str(), PING_WAIT_TIME);\n   if( ER_OK == status) {\n   ...\n}  Request non-announced data  If there is a need to request information that is not contained\nin the announcement, perform the following steps.   Join the session   Create a session with the application by using the\n   BusAttachment JoinSession API.  NOTE: The variables name and port are set from the AboutData\n   from the Announce method.  cpp\n   SessionId sessionId;\n      SessionOpts opts(SessionOpts::TRAFFIC_MESSAGES, false,\n         SessionOpts::PROXIMITY_ANY, TRANSPORT_ANY);\n      QStatus status = msgBus- JoinSession(name, port, NULL, sessionId, opts);\n      if (status == ER_OK) {\n         QCC_DbgTrace((\"JoinSession SUCCESS (Session id=%d)\", sessionId));\n      } else {\n         QCC_LogError(status, (\"JoinSession failed\"));\n      }   Create AboutClient   Generate an AboutProxyBusObject from the org.alljoyn.About\n   Introspection XML and create an instance passing ButAttachment\n   and sessionId.  cpp\n   AboutProxyBusObject * aboutClient = new AboutProxyBusObject\n      (msgBus, sender_name,\"\\About\", sessionId);\n   aboutClient- GetAboutData(\"\");   Create AboutIconClient   Generate an IconProxyBusObject from the org.alljoyn.Icon\n   Introspection XML and create an instance passing\n   ButAttachment, port, and sessionId.  cpp\n   IconProxyBusObject * aboutIconClient = new IconProxyBusObject\n      (msgBus, sender_name, \"About\\DeviceIcon\", sessionId);\n   aboutIconClient- GetUrl();  Shutdown  Once you are done using the About feature and the AllJoyn\nframework, free the variables used in the application.

If a remote device is announcing the interface(s)\nthen all Registered \nAboutListeners\n will be called.\n\n\nFor example, if you need both \ncom.example.Audio\n \nand\n\n\ncom.example.Video\n interfaces then do the following.\n\n\nRegisterAboutListener once:\n\n\nconst char* interfaces[] = {\ncom.example.Audio\n, \ncom.example.Video\n};\nRegisterAboutListener(aboutListener);\nWhoImplements(interfaces, sizeof(interfaces) / sizeof(interfaces[0]));\n\n\n\n\nIf the AboutListener should be called if \ncom.example.Audio\n \nor\n\n\ncom.example.Video\n interfaces are found then call \nWhoImplements\n multiple\ntimes:\n\n\nRegisterAboutListener(aboutListener);\nconst char* audioInterface[] = {\ncom.example.Audio\n};\nWhoImplements(audioInterface, sizeof(audioInterface) / sizeof(audioInterface[0]));\nconst char* videoInterface[] = {\ncom.example.Video\n};\nWhoImplements(videoInterface, sizeof(videoInterface) / sizeof(videoInterface[0]));\n\n\n\n\nThe interface name may be a prefix followed by a \n*\n.

The  WhoImplements  member function  The  WhoImplements  member function is used to declare your interest in one or\nmore specific interfaces.

AboutServiceImpl is also an implementation wrapper\naround AllJoyn native calls that handle the interactions between\napplications that use the AboutIconClient class.\n\n\nProvision for the Icon content and URL\n\n\nAn Icon is published directly as a byte array or a reference\nURL, and must be provisioned as follows:\n\n\nbyte [] aboutIconContent = { 0x89, 0x50, 0x4E, 0x47, 0x0D /* Add relevant data here */ };\nString mimeType(\nimage/png\n); /* This should correspond to the content */\nString url(\nhttp://myurl\n); /* An alternate access to the Icon */\n\n\n\n\nRegister icon\n\n\nRegister the relevant BusObjects and add the relevant interfaces\nto the Announcements ObjectDescription.

By using the AboutClient class, your\napplication is notified when About Server instances send announcements.\n\n\nVerify the BusAttachment has been created, started and connected\nbefore implementing an About Client. See \nSetting Up the AllJoyn Framework\n for the code snippets. These codes snippets\nreference a variable \nmBus\n (the BusAttachment variable name).\n\n\nCreate the AboutService object\n\n\nFor an application to receive AboutData, it requires an instance\nof the AboutService class. AboutServiceImpl is an implementation\nwrapper around AllJoyn native calls that handle the interactions\nwith the About Server.\n\n\nAboutService aboutService = AboutServiceImpl.getInstance();\n\n\n\n\nStart Client mode\n\n\naboutService.startAboutClient(mBus);\n\n\n\n\nSet up ability to receive the Announce signal\n\n\nIn order to receive the Announce signal from an application\nusing AboutService, a few tasks must be performed.\n\n\nImplement AnnounceHandler class\n\n\nCreate a class that implements the AboutHandler. This class\nwill be triggered when an announcement arrives.\n\n\nNOTE: onDeviceLost has been deprecated. Use BusAttachment.ping\nto detect whether an application sending an Announce signal is\npresent and responding.\n\n\npublic class MyAnnouncementHandler implements AnnouncementHandler\n{\n    @Override\n    public void onAnnouncement(String peerName, short port,\n       BusObjectDescription[] interfaces, Map\nString, Variant\n aboutMap) {\n\n        Map\nString, Object\n newMap = new HashMap\nString, Object\n();\n        try {\n            newMap = TransportUtil.fromVariantMap(aboutMap);\n            String deviceId = (String) (newMap.get(AboutKeys.ABOUT_APP_ID).toString());\n            String deviceFriendlyName = (String) newMap.get(AboutKeys.ABOUT_DEVICE_NAME);\n                m_logger.debug(TAG, \nonAnnouncement received: with parameters:\n                busName:\n+deviceName+\n\\t, port:\n+port+\n\\t, deviceid\n+deviceId+ \n\\t,\n                   deviceName:\n+deviceFriendlyName);\n            // create a client instance to connect to this peer. See possible\n            // implementation of this call in \nCreate the AboutService object\n.\n            engageWithPeer(port, peerName, interfaces, newMap);\n        } catch (BusException e) {\n            e.printStackTrace();\n        }\n    }\n\n    @Override\n    public void onDeviceLost(String serviceName) {}\n}\n\n\n\n\nRegister the class you created\n\n\nAfter starting the AboutService in \nStart Client mode\n, add\nthe following to register the class you created in \nImplement\nAnnounceHandler class\n.\n\n\nWhen registering an announcement listener, specify which interfaces\nthe application is interested in. The code below shows a listener\nregistered to receive Announce signals that include an object\nimplementing the INTERFACE_NAME interface.\n\n\nMyAnnouncementHandler announceHandler = new MyAnnouncementHandler();\naboutService.addAnnouncementHandler(announceHandler, new String[] { INTERFACE_NAME });\n\n\n\n\nUsing ping to determine presence\n\n\nThe BusAttachment ping member function can be used to determine\nif a device is responsive. Contents of an Announce signal can\nbe stale so it may be useful to ping the device to see if it\nis still present and responsive before attempting to form a connection.\n\n\nNOTE: The BusAttachment.ping method makes a bus call. If ping is\ncalled inside an AllJoyn callback, BusAttachment.enableConcurrentCallbacks\nmust be called first.\n\n\n// When pinging a remote bus name wait a max of 5 seconds\nprivate final int PING_WAIT_TIME = 5000;\nmBus.enableConcurrentCallbacks();\nStatus status = mBus.ping(peerName, PING_WAIT_TIME);\nif (Status.OK == status) {\n}\n\n\n\n\nRequest non-announced data\n\n\nIf there is a need to request information that is not contained\nin the announcement, perform the following steps.\n\n\nCreate AboutClient\n\n\nGenerate an instance of AboutClient to engage with a peer\nAbout Server whose Announcement was received in the\nonAnnouncement() implementation of your MyAnnouncementHandler instance.\n\n\nUsing the AboutClient instance you can exercise the About\nfeature API as described in the \nAbout Interface Definition\n.\n\n\nThe following is an example implementation of the call\nshown in \nImplement AnnounceHandler class\n.\n\n\nprivate void engageWithPeer(Short port, String peerName, BusObjectDescription[]\ninterfaces, Map\nString, Object\n announceMap) {\n    MyAvailabilityListener availabilityListener = new MyAvailabilityListener();\n    AboutClient aboutClient = aboutService.createAboutClient(peerName, availabilityListener, port);\n    aboutClient.connect();\n    // Use the generated AboutClient instance according to your needs.\n    // E.g. retrieve AboutData\n    Map \nString, Object\n aboutData =\n    aboutClient.getAbout((String)announceMap.get(\nDefaultLanaguge\n));\n    // E.g. retrieve ObjectDescription\n    BusObjectDescription [] od = aboutClient.getBusObjectDescription();\n}\n\n\n\n\nRequest AboutData\n\n\nAboutData is retrieved via the AboutClient. The structure that\nis returned can be iterated through to determine the contents.\nThe content definition is found in the \nAbout Interface Definition\n.\n\n\naboutClient.getAbout((String)announceMap.get(\nDefaultLanaguge\n));\n\n\n\n\nCreate AboutIconClient (optional)\n\n\nGenerate an instance of AboutIconClient to receive the DeviceIcon\nout of a peer About Server whose Announcement was received in\nthe onAnnouncement() implementation of your MyAnnouncementHandler instance.\n\n\nThe following is an example implementation of the call shown\nin \nImplement AnnounceHandler class\n.\n\n\nprivate void engageWithPeer(Short port, String peerName, BusObjectDescription[]\ninterfaces, Map\nString, Object\n announceMap) {\n    MyAvailabilityListener availabilityListener = new MyAvailabilityListener();\n    boolean hasIcon = false;\n    for (BusObjectDescription bod : objectDescriptionArray) {\n        if (bod.path.equals(\n/About/DeviceIcon\n) {\n            hasIcon = true;\n            break;\n        }\n    }\n    if (hasIcon) {\n        AboutIconClient aboutIconClient = aboutService.createAboutIconClient(peerName, availabilityListener, port);\n        aboutIconClient.connect();\n        // Use the generated AboutIconClient instance according to your needs.\n        // E.g. retrieve icon content\n        byte [] iconContent = aboutIconClient.GetContent();\n    }\n}\n\n\n\n\nRequest the icon content (optional)\n\n\nThe icon data is requested through the AboutClientIcon.\nThe structure that is returned can be iterated through\nto determine the contents. The content definition is found\nin the \nAbout Interface Definition\n.\n\n\naboutIconClient.GetContent();\n\n\n\n\nReleasing resources\n\n\nOnce you are done using the About feature and the AllJoyn\nframework, unregister listeners, disconnect and stop the\nclients, services, and the BusAttachment used in the application.\n\n\nif(aboutClient != null) {\n    aboutClient.disconnect();\n}\nif(aboutService != null) {\n    aboutService.unregisterAnnounceListener(announceListener);\n    aboutService.stopClient();\n}\nif(mBus != null) {\n    mBus.disconnect();\n    mBus.release();\n    mBus = null;\n}",

AboutService aboutService = AboutServiceImpl.getInstance();  Start Client mode  aboutService.startAboutClient(mBus);  Set up ability to receive the Announce signal  In order to receive the Announce signal from an application\nusing AboutService, a few tasks must be performed.  Implement AnnounceHandler class  Create a class that implements the AboutHandler. This class\nwill be triggered when an announcement arrives.  NOTE: onDeviceLost has been deprecated. Use BusAttachment.ping\nto detect whether an application sending an Announce signal is\npresent and responding.  public class MyAnnouncementHandler implements AnnouncementHandler\n{\n    @Override\n    public void onAnnouncement(String peerName, short port,\n       BusObjectDescription[] interfaces, Map String, Variant  aboutMap) {\n\n        Map String, Object  newMap = new HashMap String, Object ();\n        try {\n            newMap = TransportUtil.fromVariantMap(aboutMap);\n            String deviceId = (String) (newMap.get(AboutKeys.ABOUT_APP_ID).toString());\n            String deviceFriendlyName = (String) newMap.get(AboutKeys.ABOUT_DEVICE_NAME);\n                m_logger.debug(TAG,  onAnnouncement received: with parameters:\n                busName: +deviceName+ \\t, port: +port+ \\t, deviceid +deviceId+  \\t,\n                   deviceName: +deviceFriendlyName);\n            // create a client instance to connect to this peer. See possible\n            // implementation of this call in  Create the AboutService object .\n            engageWithPeer(port, peerName, interfaces, newMap);\n        } catch (BusException e) {\n            e.printStackTrace();\n        }\n    }\n\n    @Override\n    public void onDeviceLost(String serviceName) {}\n}  Register the class you created  After starting the AboutService in  Start Client mode , add\nthe following to register the class you created in  Implement\nAnnounceHandler class .  When registering an announcement listener, specify which interfaces\nthe application is interested in. The code below shows a listener\nregistered to receive Announce signals that include an object\nimplementing the INTERFACE_NAME interface.  MyAnnouncementHandler announceHandler = new MyAnnouncementHandler();\naboutService.addAnnouncementHandler(announceHandler, new String[] { INTERFACE_NAME });  Using ping to determine presence  The BusAttachment ping member function can be used to determine\nif a device is responsive. Contents of an Announce signal can\nbe stale so it may be useful to ping the device to see if it\nis still present and responsive before attempting to form a connection.  NOTE: The BusAttachment.ping method makes a bus call. If ping is\ncalled inside an AllJoyn callback, BusAttachment.enableConcurrentCallbacks\nmust be called first.  // When pinging a remote bus name wait a max of 5 seconds\nprivate final int PING_WAIT_TIME = 5000;\nmBus.enableConcurrentCallbacks();\nStatus status = mBus.ping(peerName, PING_WAIT_TIME);\nif (Status.OK == status) {\n}  Request non-announced data  If there is a need to request information that is not contained\nin the announcement, perform the following steps.  Create AboutClient  Generate an instance of AboutClient to engage with a peer\nAbout Server whose Announcement was received in the\nonAnnouncement() implementation of your MyAnnouncementHandler instance.  Using the AboutClient instance you can exercise the About\nfeature API as described in the  About Interface Definition .  The following is an example implementation of the call\nshown in  Implement AnnounceHandler class .  private void engageWithPeer(Short port, String peerName, BusObjectDescription[]\ninterfaces, Map String, Object  announceMap) {\n    MyAvailabilityListener availabilityListener = new MyAvailabilityListener();\n    AboutClient aboutClient = aboutService.createAboutClient(peerName, availabilityListener, port);\n    aboutClient.connect();\n    // Use the generated AboutClient instance according to your needs.\n    // E.g. retrieve AboutData\n    Map  String, Object  aboutData =\n    aboutClient.getAbout((String)announceMap.get( DefaultLanaguge ));\n    // E.g. retrieve ObjectDescription\n    BusObjectDescription [] od = aboutClient.getBusObjectDescription();\n}  Request AboutData  AboutData is retrieved via the AboutClient. The structure that\nis returned can be iterated through to determine the contents.\nThe content definition is found in the  About Interface Definition .  aboutClient.getAbout((String)announceMap.get( DefaultLanaguge ));  Create AboutIconClient (optional)  Generate an instance of AboutIconClient to receive the DeviceIcon\nout of a peer About Server whose Announcement was received in\nthe onAnnouncement() implementation of your MyAnnouncementHandler instance.  The following is an example implementation of the call shown\nin  Implement AnnounceHandler class .  private void engageWithPeer(Short port, String peerName, BusObjectDescription[]\ninterfaces, Map String, Object  announceMap) {\n    MyAvailabilityListener availabilityListener = new MyAvailabilityListener();\n    boolean hasIcon = false;\n    for (BusObjectDescription bod : objectDescriptionArray) {\n        if (bod.path.equals( /About/DeviceIcon ) {\n            hasIcon = true;\n            break;\n        }\n    }\n    if (hasIcon) {\n        AboutIconClient aboutIconClient = aboutService.createAboutIconClient(peerName, availabilityListener, port);\n        aboutIconClient.connect();\n        // Use the generated AboutIconClient instance according to your needs.\n        // E.g. retrieve icon content\n        byte [] iconContent = aboutIconClient.GetContent();\n    }\n}  Request the icon content (optional)  The icon data is requested through the AboutClientIcon.\nThe structure that is returned can be iterated through\nto determine the contents. The content definition is found\nin the  About Interface Definition .  aboutIconClient.GetContent();  Releasing resources  Once you are done using the About feature and the AllJoyn\nframework, unregister listeners, disconnect and stop the\nclients, services, and the BusAttachment used in the application.  if(aboutClient != null) {\n    aboutClient.disconnect();\n}\nif(aboutService != null) {\n    aboutService.unregisterAnnounceListener(announceListener);\n    aboutService.stopClient();\n}\nif(mBus != null) {\n    mBus.disconnect();\n    mBus.release();\n    mBus = null;\n}",

If a remote device is announcing the interface(s) then\nall Registered `AboutListeners` will be called.\n\nFor example, if you need both `com.example.Audio` *and*\n`com.example.Video` interfaces then do the following.\n\nRegister `AboutListener` once:\n```java\nString ifaces[] = {\ncom.example.Audio\n, \ncom.example.Video\n};\nRegisterAboutListener(aboutListener);\nbus.whoImplements(ifaces));\n\n\n\n\nIf the \nAboutListener\n should be called if \ncom.example.Audio\n \nor\n\n\ncom.example.Video\n interfaces are found then call \nWhoImplements\n multiple\ntimes:\n\n\nRegisterAboutListener(aboutListener);\nString audioInterface[] = {\ncom.example.Audio\n};\nbus.whoImplements(audioInterface);\nString videoInterface[] = {\ncom.example.Video\n};\nbus.whoImplements(videoInterface);\n\n\n\n\nThe interface name may be a prefix followed by a \n*\n.  Using this, the example\nwhere we are interested in \ncom.example.Audio\n \nor\n \ncom.example.Video\n\ninterfaces could be written as:\n\n\nString exampleInterface[] = {\ncom.example.*\n};\nRegisterAboutListener(aboutListener);\nWhoImplements(exampleInterface);\n\n\n\n\nThe AboutListener will receive any announcement that implements an interface\nbeginning with the \ncom.example.\n name.\n\n\nIt is the AboutListeners responsibility to parse through the reported interfaces\nto figure out what should be done in response to the \nAnnounce\n signal.\n\n\nCalls to \nwhoImplements\n is ref counted. If \nwhoImplements\n is called with the same\nlist of interfaces multiple times then \ncancelWhoImplements\n must also be called\nmultiple times with the same list of interfaces.\n\n\nSpecifying \nnull\n for the \ninterfaces\n parameter is allowed, however, it\ncould have significant impact on network performance and should be avoided\nunless all announcements are needed.\n\n\nAdd an AboutIcon (optional)\n\n\nAn application that sends an \nAnnounce\n signal  can be extended to broadcast a\ndevice icon using an instance of the \nAboutIconObj\n class.\n\n\nProvision for the Icon content and URL\n\n\nAn icon is published directly as a byte array or a reference URL, and is\nprovisioned as follows:\n\n\nCreate an icon using a byte array.  An Icon size of 72 pixels x 72 pixels is\nrecommended.\n\n\nbyte[] iconContent = { (byte)0x89, 0x50, 0x4E, 0x47/* Add relevant data here */ };\nAboutIcon icon = null;\ntry {\n    icon = new AboutIcon(\nimage/png\n, iconContent);\n} catch (BusException e) {\n    System.out.println(\nAboutIcon threw a BusException when it was unexpected.\n);\n}\n\n\n\n\nCreate an icon using a URL.\n\n\nAboutIcon icon = null;\ntry {\n    icon = new AboutIcon(\nimage/png\n, \nhttp://www.example.com\n);\n} catch (BusException e) {\n    System.out.println(\nAboutIcon threw a BusException when it was unexpected.\n);\n}\n\n\n\n\nAs long as the MimeType of the Url and the icon content are the same.

The map is\nexpected to contain only the data fields that are announced.\nSee  About interface data fields . Feilds that have\nmultiple strings in multiple langauges will always return the language specified\nin the  DefaultLanguage  tag for the announced data.  The  getAboutData  method is called by the AllJoyn framework when a  AboutProxy \nobject calls  AboutProxy.getAboutData()  method. The language  must  be an\nIETF language tage specified by RFC 5646.  Important  if the language parameter\nis null or an empty string the about data for the  DefaultLanguage  should be\nreturned.

See  Create a new  BusAttachment  Implement an  AboutListener  static class MyAboutListener implements AboutListener {\n    public void announced(String busName, int version, short port, AboutObjectDescription[] objectDescriptions, Map String, Variant  aboutData) {\n        // Place code here to handle Announce signal.\n    }\n}  The  AboutListener  is called by the AllJoyn routing node when an  Announce \nsignal is found.

This information can be used\nto form a session with the remote device; and Make a  ProxyBus  object based on\nthe interfaces reported in the  objectDescriptions .

If a remote device is announcing the interface(s) then\nall Registered `AboutListeners` will be called.\n\nFor example, if you need both `com.example.Audio` *and*\n`com.example.Video` interfaces then do the following.\n\nRegister `AboutListener` once:\n```java\nString ifaces[] = { com.example.Audio ,  com.example.Video };\nRegisterAboutListener(aboutListener);\nbus.whoImplements(ifaces));  If the  AboutListener  should be called if  com.example.Audio   or  com.example.Video  interfaces are found then call  WhoImplements  multiple\ntimes:  RegisterAboutListener(aboutListener);\nString audioInterface[] = { com.example.Audio };\nbus.whoImplements(audioInterface);\nString videoInterface[] = { com.example.Video };\nbus.whoImplements(videoInterface);  The interface name may be a prefix followed by a  * .  Using this, the example\nwhere we are interested in  com.example.Audio   or   com.example.Video \ninterfaces could be written as:  String exampleInterface[] = { com.example.* };\nRegisterAboutListener(aboutListener);\nWhoImplements(exampleInterface);  The AboutListener will receive any announcement that implements an interface\nbeginning with the  com.example.  name.  It is the AboutListeners responsibility to parse through the reported interfaces\nto figure out what should be done in response to the  Announce  signal.  Calls to  whoImplements  is ref counted. If  whoImplements  is called with the same\nlist of interfaces multiple times then  cancelWhoImplements  must also be called\nmultiple times with the same list of interfaces.  Specifying  null  for the  interfaces  parameter is allowed, however, it\ncould have significant impact on network performance and should be avoided\nunless all announcements are needed.  Add an AboutIcon (optional)  An application that sends an  Announce  signal  can be extended to broadcast a\ndevice icon using an instance of the  AboutIconObj  class.  Provision for the Icon content and URL  An icon is published directly as a byte array or a reference URL, and is\nprovisioned as follows:  Create an icon using a byte array.  An Icon size of 72 pixels x 72 pixels is\nrecommended.  byte[] iconContent = { (byte)0x89, 0x50, 0x4E, 0x47/* Add relevant data here */ };\nAboutIcon icon = null;\ntry {\n    icon = new AboutIcon( image/png , iconContent);\n} catch (BusException e) {\n    System.out.println( AboutIcon threw a BusException when it was unexpected. );\n}  Create an icon using a URL.  AboutIcon icon = null;\ntry {\n    icon = new AboutIcon( image/png ,  http://www.example.com );\n} catch (BusException e) {\n    System.out.println( AboutIcon threw a BusException when it was unexpected. );\n}  As long as the MimeType of the Url and the icon content are the same. Both the\nUrl and icon content can be set.  byte[] iconContent = { (byte)0x89, 0x50, 0x4E, 0x47/* Add relevant data here */ };\nAboutIcon icon = null;\ntry {\n    icon = new AboutIcon( image/png ,  http://www.example.com , iconContent);\n} catch (BusException e) {\n    System.out.println( AboutIcon threw a BusException when it was unexpected. );\n}  AboutIconObj  The  AboutIconObj  will create and register a  BusObject  to handle remote\nmethod calls made on the  org.alljoyn.Icon  interface.  The AboutIconObj is\nannounced by default.  Applications interested in the  org.alljoyn.Icon \ninterface can call WhoImplements( org.alljoyn.Icon ) to find applications\nthat broadcast device icon information.  Announce the  org.alljoyn.Icon  interface:  AboutIconObj aio = new AboutIconObj(bus, icon);\nAboutObj aboutObj = new AboutObj(bus);\nstatus = aboutObj.announce(PORT_NUMBER, aboutData));  Discover the  org.alljoyn.Icon interface  status = clientBus.whoImplements(new String[] {org.alljoyn.bus.ifaces.Icon.INTERFACE_NAME});  Using Ping to determine presence  The  BusAttachment   Ping  method can be used to determine\nif a device is responsive. Contents of an  org.alljoyn.About.Announce  signal can\nbe stale so it is recommended to ping the device to see if it is still present\nand responsive before attempting to form a connection.  NOTE:  The  BusAttachment.ping  method makes a bus call. If  BusAttachment.ping \nis called inside an AllJoyn callback,  BusAttachment.enableConcurrentCallbacks \nmust be called first.  // pinging a remote bus, wait a max of 5 seconds\nbus.enableConcurrentCallbacks();\nQStatus status = bus.ping(busName.c_str(), 5000);\nif( ER_OK == status) {\n   // remote device found\n   ...\n}  Request non-announced data  If there is a need to request information that is not contained in the\nannouncement, perform the following steps.   Join the session   Create a session with the application by calling  BusAttachment.joinSession .  NOTE:  The variables name and port are obtained from the\n   AboutListener::Announced member function.  ```java\n   SessionOpts sessionOpts = new SessionOpts();\n   sessionOpts.traffic = SessionOpts.TRAFFIC_MESSAGES;\n   sessionOpts.isMultipoint = false;\n   sessionOpts.proximity = SessionOpts.PROXIMITY_ANY;\n   sessionOpts.transports = SessionOpts.TRANSPORT_ANY;  Mutable.IntegerValue sessionId = new Mutable.IntegerValue();  bus.enableConcurrentCallbacks();  Status status = bus.joinSession(busName, port, sessionId, sessionOpts, new SessionListener());\n   if (status != Status.OK) {\n       return;\n   }\n   ```   Create an  AboutProxy   Generate an About ProxyBusObject by passing the local  BusAttachment , the\n   name of the remote  BusAttachment , and the  SessionId  obtained from the\n    BusAttachment.joinSession  call.     java\n   AboutProxy aboutProxy = new AboutProxy(mBus, busName, sessionId.value);\n   try {\n        Map String, Variant  aboutData;\n        aboutData = aboutProxy.getAboutData(\"en\");\n   } catch (BusException e) {\n       System.out.println(\"Unexpected BusException.\")\n   }   Create  AboutIconProxy  (optional)   Generate an Icon ProxyBusObject by passing the local  BusAttachment , the\n   name of the remote  BusAttachment , and the  SessionId  obtained from the\n    BusAttachment.joinSession  call.  ```java\n   AboutIconProxy aiProxy = new AboutIconProxy(clientBus, aListener.remoteBusName, sessionPortlistener.sessionId);\n   AboutIcon aIcon;\n   try {\n       aIcon = aiProxy.getAboutIcon();\n   } catch (BusException e) {\n       System.out.println(\"Unexpected BusException.\");\n   }  // Get the Url\n   String url = aIcon.getUrl();\n   // Get the content\n   byte[] content = aIcon.getContent();\n   // Get the MimeType\n   String mimeType = aIcon.getMimeType();\n   ```",

In the sample implementation \nabove, the PropertyStore instance is provided with a default values map.\n\n\nThe following subsections highlight provisioning fields \naccording to their data type.\n\n\nAppId field\n\n\nThe AppId field is an array of bytes. It is a globally unique \nidentifier (GUID) encoded as an array of 16 bytes.\n\n\nself.uniqueID = [[NSUUID UUID] UUIDString]; \n\n[self.aboutPropertyStoreImpl setAppId:self.uniqueID];\n\n\n\n\nSupportedLanguages field\n\n\nThe SupportedLanguages field is a list of text strings. \nSome fields can have a language-dependent value that must \nbe provided for each of the supported languages.\n\n\nNSArray *languages = @[@\nen\n, @\nsp\n, @\nfr\n]; \n\n[self.aboutPropertyStoreImpl setSupportedLangs:languages];\n\n\n\n\nNon-language-specific fields\n\n\nNon-language-specific fields support a single supplied text \nstring. Following is an example for the ModelNumber field on \nhow to insert into the PropertyStore. The code below can be \nused with the field name being replaced by other field names \nlisted in \nAbout data interface fields\n.\n\n\n[self.aboutPropertyStoreImpl setModelNumber:@\nWxfy388i\n];\n\n\n\n\nLanguage-dependent fields\n\n\nLanguage-dependent fields support a single supplied text string. \nBelow is an example for the Description field on how to insert \ninto the PropertyStore. The code below can be used with the \nfield name being replaced by other field names listed in \nAbout data interface fields\n.\n\n\n[self.aboutPropertyStoreImpl setDescription:@\nThis is an AllJoyn application\n language:@\nen\n];\n\n[self.aboutPropertyStoreImpl setDescription:@\nEsta es una AllJoyn aplicacion\n language:@\nsp\n];\n\n[self.aboutPropertyStoreImpl setDescription:@\nC'est une AllJoyn application\n language:@\nfr\n];\n\n\n\n\nCreate the AboutService object\n\n\nFor an application to send AboutData, it requires an instance \nof the AboutService class. AboutServiceImpl is an implementation \nwrapper around AllJoyn native calls that handle the interactions \nbetween About Service and About Client.\n\n\nAboutService aboutService = AboutServiceImpl.getInstance();\n\n\n\n\nStart Service mode\n\n\nRegister the relevant BusObjects and add the relevant interfaces \nto the Announcement's ObjectDescription.\n\n\n[self.aboutServiceApi startWithBus:self.serviceBusAttachment \n   andPropertyStore:self.aboutPropertyStoreImpl];\n\n\n\n\nAdd an AboutIconService (optional)\n\n\nAn application that sends AboutData can be extended to broadcast \na device. AboutServiceImpl is also an implementation wrapper \naround AllJoyn native calls that handle the interactions \nbetween applications that use the AboutIconClient class.\n\n\nProvision for the Icon content and URL\n\n\nAn Icon is published directly as a byte array or a reference \nURL, and must be provisioned as follows:\n\n\nuint8_t aboutIconContent[] = { 0x89, 0x50, 0x4E, 0x47, 0x0D, 0x0A, 0x1A, 0x0A,\n0x00, 0x00, 0x00, 0x0D, 0x49, 0x48, 0x44,\n   0x52, 0x00, 0x00, 0x00, 0x0A, 0x00, 0x00, 0x00, 0x0A, 0x08, 0x02, 0x00, 0x00,\n\n0x00, 0x02, 0x50, 0x58, 0xEA, 0x00,\n   0x00, 0x00, 0x04, 0x67, 0x41, 0x4D, 0x41, 0x00, 0x00, 0xAF, 0xC8, 0x37, 0x05,\n\n0x8A, 0xE9, 0x00, 0x00, 0x00, 0x19,\n   0x74, 0x45, 0x58, 0x74, 0x53, 0x6F, 0x66, 0x74, 0x77, 0x61, 0x72, 0x65, 0x00,\n\n0x41, 0x64, 0x6F, 0x62, 0x65, 0x20,\n   0x49, 0x6D, 0x61, 0x67, 0x65, 0x52, 0x65, 0x61, 0x64, 0x79, 0x71, 0xC9, 0x65,\n\n0x3C, 0x00, 0x00, 0x00, 0x18, 0x49,\n   0x44, 0x41, 0x54, 0x78, 0xDA, 0x62, 0xFC, 0x3F, 0x95, 0x9F, 0x01, 0x37, 0x60,\n\n0x62, 0xC0, 0x0B, 0x46, 0xAA, 0x34,\n   0x40, 0x80, 0x01, 0x00, 0x06, 0x7C, 0x01, 0xB7, 0xED, 0x4B, 0x53, 0x2C, 0x00,\n\n0x00, 0x00, 0x00, 0x49, 0x45, 0x4E,\n   0x44, 0xAE, 0x42, 0x60, 0x82 };\n\n};\n\nNSString *mimeType = @\nimage/png\n; /* This should correspond \n   to the content */ NSString *url = @\nhttp://tinyurl.com/llrqvrb\n; \n   /* An alternate access to the Icon\n*/\n\n\n\n\nCreate and register DeviceIcon object\n\n\nRegister the relevant BusObjects and add the relevant interfaces \nto the Announcement's ObjectDescription.\n\n\nself.aboutIconService = [[AJNAboutIconService alloc] initWithBus:self.serviceBusAttachment \n   mimeType:mimeType url:url content:aboutIconContent csize:csize];\n\n[self.aboutIconService registerAboutIconService];\n\n\n\n\nAdvertise to allow connections\n\n\n[self.serviceBusAttachment advertiseName:([self.serviceBusAttachment uniqueName])\nwithTransportMask:(kAJNTransportMaskAny)];\n\n\n\n\nSend the Announcement\n\n\n[self.aboutServiceApi announce];\n\n\n\n\nUnregister and delete AboutService and BusAttachment\n\n\nWhen your process is done with the AboutService and no longer \nwishes to send announcements, unregister the process from the \nAllJoyn bus and then delete variables used.\n\n\n// Stop AboutIcon\n[self.serviceBusAttachment unregisterBusObject:self.aboutIconService];\nself.aboutIconService = nil;\n\n// Delete AboutServiceApi [self.aboutServiceApi destroyInstance]; \n   self.aboutServiceApi = nil;\n\n// Delete AboutPropertyStoreImpl self.aboutPropertyStoreImpl = nil;\n\n// Bus attachment cleanup\n[self.serviceBusAttachment cancelAdvertisedName:[self.serviceBusAttachment \n   uniqueName] withTransportMask:kAJNTransportMaskAny];\n\n[self.serviceBusAttachment unbindSessionFromPort:SERVICE_PORT];\n\n// Delete AboutSessionPortListener\n[self.serviceBusAttachment unregisterBusListener:self.aboutSessionPortListener];\nself.aboutSessionPortListener = nil;\n\n// Stop bus attachment\n[self.serviceBusAttachment stop];\nself.serviceBusAttachment = nil;\n\n\n\n\nImplementing an Application that Uses AboutClient\n\n\nTo implement an application to receive AboutData, use the \nAboutClient class. By using the AboutClient class, your \napplication is notified when About Service instances \nsend announcements.\n\n\nVerify the BusAttachment has been created, started and \nconnected before implementing an About Client. See \nSetting \nUp the AllJoyn Framework\n for the \ncode snippets. Code in this chapter references a variable \n\nself.clientBusAttachment\n (the BusAttachment variable name).\n\n\nSetup to receive the Announce signal\n\n\nIn order to receive the Announce signal from an application \nusing AboutService, a class implementation of AJNAnnouncementListener \nprotocol must be created.\n\n\nCreate class to implement AJNAnnouncementListener protocol\n\n\nThis declaration of a class will allow for the signals to \nbe received. It must implement the pure virtual function Announce.\n\n\n@interface sampleClass \nAJNAnnouncementListener\n\n\n- (void)announceWithVersion:(uint16_t)version \n                       port:(uint16_t)port\n                    busName:(NSString *)busName \n         objectDescriptions:(NSMutableDictionary *)objectDescs\n                  aboutData:(NSMutableDictionary **)aboutData {\n// add your implementation here\n}\n\n\n\n\nImplement the Announce method that handles the Announce signal\n\n\nWith everything linked up using the AllJoyn framework, the \nmethod registered with the AllJoyn framework will be executed \nupon receipt of an Announce signal.\n\n\nBecause every application is different, as a developer you \nmust process the AboutData and determine the following:\n\n\n\n\nHow it should be rendered in the UI.\n\n\nWhen to request the data that is not contained in the Announce signal.\n\n\nAny logic that is needed.\n\n\n\n\nRegister the AJNAnnouncementListener\n\n\nWhen registering an announcement listener, specify which \ninterfaces the application is interested in. The code below \nshows a listener registered to receive Announce signals \nthat include an object implementing the INTERFACE_NAME interface.\n\n\nself.announcementReceiver = [[AJNAnnouncementReceiver alloc]\ninitWithAnnouncementListener:self andBus:self.clientBusAttachment];\n\nconst char* interfaces[] = { [INTERFACE_NAME UTF8String] }; \n\n[self.announcementReceiver registerAnnouncementReceiverForInterfaces:interfaces\n   withNumberOfInterfaces:1];\n\n\n\n\nUsing ping to determine presence\n\n\nThe AJNBusAttachment pingPeer member function can be used to \ndetermine if a device is responsive. Contents of an Announce \nsignal can be stale so it may be useful to ping the device to \nsee if it is still present and responsive before attempting \nto form a connection.\n\n\nNOTE: The AJNBusAttachment pingPeer method makes a bus call. \nIf pingPeer is called inside an AllJoyn callback, \nAJNBusAttachment \nenableConcurrentCallbacks\n must be called first.\n\n\n// When pinging a remote bus name wait a max of 5 seconds\n[self.clientBusAttachment enableConcurrentCallbacks];\nQStatus status = [self.clientBusAttachment pingPeer:busName \n  withTimeout:5000];\nif (ER_OK == status) {\n   ...\n}\n\n\n\n\nRequest non-announced data\n\n\nIf there is a need to request information that is not contained \nin the announcement (meaning they are not marked as announcable), \ncomplete the tasks in the following subsections.\n\n\nJoin a session\n\n\nCreate a session with the application by using the \nBusAttachment JoinSession API.\n\n\nNOTE: The variables name and port are set from the AboutData \nfrom the Announce method.\n\n\nAJNSessionOptions *opt = [[AJNSessionOptions alloc] \ninitWithTrafficType:kAJNTrafficMessages supportsMultipoint:false \nproximity:kAJNProximityAny transportMask:kAJNTransportMaskAny];\n\n\nself.sessionId = [self.clientBusAttachment \n      joinSessionWithName:[self.clientInformation.announcement busName]\n            onPort:[self.clientInformation.announcement port]\n            withDelegate:(nil) options:opt];\n\n\n\n\nCreate AboutClient\n\n\nGenerate an AJNAboutClient and create an instance passing in \nthe BusAttachment that was created in \nStart and connect the \nBusAttachment\n.\n\n\nAJNAboutClient *ajnAboutClient = [[AJNAboutClient alloc]\ninitWithBus:self.clientBusAttachment];\n\n\n\n\nCreate AJNAboutIconClient\n\n\nGenerate an AJNAboutIconClient and create an instance passing \nin the BusAttachment created in \nStart and connect the BusAttachment\n.\n\n\nself.ajnAboutIconClient = [[AJNAboutIconClient alloc]\ninitWithBus:self.clientBusAttachment];\n\n[self.ajnAboutIconClient urlFromBusName:announcementBusName url:\nurl \nsessionId:self.sessionID];\n\n\n\n\nShutdown\n\n\nOnce you are done using the About feature and the AllJoyn \nframework, free the variables used in the application.\n\n\nself.clientBusAttachment = nil;",

By using the AboutClient class, your\napplication is notified when About Service instances\nsend announcements.\n\n\nVerify the BusAttachment has been created, started and\nconnected before implementing an About Client. See \nSetting\nUp the AllJoyn Framework\n for the\ncode snippets. Code in this chapter references a variable\n\nself.clientBusAttachment\n (the BusAttachment variable name).\n\n\nSetup to receive the Announce signal\n\n\nIn order to receive the Announce signal from an application\nusing AboutService, a class implementation of AJNAnnouncementListener\nprotocol must be created.\n\n\nCreate class to implement AJNAnnouncementListener protocol\n\n\nThis declaration of a class will allow for the signals to\nbe received. It must implement the pure virtual function Announce.\n\n\n@interface sampleClass \nAJNAnnouncementListener\n\n\n- (void)announceWithVersion:(uint16_t)version\n                       port:(uint16_t)port\n                    busName:(NSString *)busName\n         objectDescriptions:(NSMutableDictionary *)objectDescs\n                  aboutData:(NSMutableDictionary **)aboutData {\n// add your implementation here\n}\n\n\n\n\nImplement the Announce method that handles the Announce signal\n\n\nWith everything linked up using the AllJoyn framework, the\nmethod registered with the AllJoyn framework will be executed\nupon receipt of an Announce signal.\n\n\nBecause every application is different, as a developer you\nmust process the AboutData and determine the following:\n\n\n\n\nHow it should be rendered in the UI.\n\n\nWhen to request the data that is not contained in the Announce signal.\n\n\nAny logic that is needed.\n\n\n\n\nRegister the AJNAnnouncementListener\n\n\nWhen registering an announcement listener, specify which\ninterfaces the application is interested in. The code below\nshows a listener registered to receive Announce signals\nthat include an object implementing the INTERFACE_NAME interface.\n\n\nself.announcementReceiver = [[AJNAnnouncementReceiver alloc]\ninitWithAnnouncementListener:self andBus:self.clientBusAttachment];\n\nconst char* interfaces[] = { [INTERFACE_NAME UTF8String] };\n\n[self.announcementReceiver registerAnnouncementReceiverForInterfaces:interfaces\n   withNumberOfInterfaces:1];\n\n\n\n\nUsing ping to determine presence\n\n\nThe AJNBusAttachment pingPeer member function can be used to\ndetermine if a device is responsive. Contents of an Announce\nsignal can be stale so it may be useful to ping the device to\nsee if it is still present and responsive before attempting\nto form a connection.\n\n\nNOTE:\n The AJNBusAttachment pingPeer method makes a bus call.\nIf pingPeer is called inside an AllJoyn callback, \nAJNBusAttachment\nenableConcurrentCallbacks\n must be called first.\n\n\n// When pinging a remote bus name wait a max of 5 seconds\n[self.clientBusAttachment enableConcurrentCallbacks];\nQStatus status = [self.clientBusAttachment pingPeer:busName\n  withTimeout:5000];\nif (ER_OK == status) {\n   ...\n}\n\n\n\n\nRequest non-announced data\n\n\nIf there is a need to request information that is not contained\nin the announcement (meaning they are not marked as announcable),\ncomplete the tasks in the following subsections.\n\n\nJoin a session\n\n\nCreate a session with the application by using the\nBusAttachment JoinSession API.\n\n\nNOTE:\n The variables name and port are set from the AboutData\nfrom the Announce method.\n\n\nAJNSessionOptions *opt = [[AJNSessionOptions alloc]\ninitWithTrafficType:kAJNTrafficMessages supportsMultipoint:false\nproximity:kAJNProximityAny transportMask:kAJNTransportMaskAny];\n\n\nself.sessionId = [self.clientBusAttachment\n      joinSessionWithName:[self.clientInformation.announcement busName]\n            onPort:[self.clientInformation.announcement port]\n            withDelegate:(nil) options:opt];\n\n\n\n\nCreate AboutClient\n\n\nGenerate an AJNAboutClient and create an instance passing in\nthe BusAttachment that was created in \nStart and connect the\nBusAttachment\n.\n\n\nAJNAboutClient *ajnAboutClient = [[AJNAboutClient alloc]\ninitWithBus:self.clientBusAttachment];\n\n\n\n\nCreate AJNAboutIconClient\n\n\nGenerate an AJNAboutIconClient and create an instance passing\nin the BusAttachment created in \nStart and connect the BusAttachment\n.\n\n\nself.ajnAboutIconClient = [[AJNAboutIconClient alloc]\ninitWithBus:self.clientBusAttachment];\n\n[self.ajnAboutIconClient urlFromBusName:announcementBusName url:\nurl\nsessionId:self.sessionID];\n\n\n\n\nShutdown\n\n\nOnce you are done using the About feature and the AllJoyn\nframework, free the variables used in the application.\n\n\nself.clientBusAttachment = nil;",

Setup to receive the Announce signal  In order to receive the Announce signal from an application\nusing AboutService, a class implementation of AJNAnnouncementListener\nprotocol must be created.

If a Sink does not support your preferred format, SinkPlayer  automatically defaults to raw audio.  NOTE:  This must be called prior to adding a Sink using  AddSink() .  To support ALAC (Apple Lossless):  g_sinkPlayer- SetPreferredFormat(MIMETYPE_AUDIO_ALAC);  To support RAW audio support:  g_sinkPlayer- SetPreferredFormat(MIMETYPE_AUDIO_RAW);  Set the data source  To best support multiple audio file formats, a DataSource\nclass is created that represents how the audio file will be\ndecoded and read. Currently, support for WAV files is provided.\nAdding support for other audio formats will require implementing\na new class derived from DataSource.\nA .WAV file example follows.

If your target environment uses a different sound\ncard API, you must do the following:   Implement a new AudioDevice subclass.  When creating a StreamObject create a new instance of the AudioDevice\nand pass it into the StreamObject constructor. For example:   cpp\n  audioDevice = new MyAudioDevice();\n  streamObj = new StreamObject(msgBus, \"/Speaker/In\", audioDevice,\n  sessionPort, aboutProps);  The following defines the AudioDevice methods your subclass must implement.     Method  Description      Open()  Open and prepare the audio device for playback, and start playing as soon as it receives data.    Close()  Close audio device and free any resources.    Play()  Start audio device playback.    Pause()  Pause audio device playback.    Play()  Resume after a pause.    Recover()  Recover from underrun if one has occurred.    GetDelay()  Get audio device delay (time until new samples will be audible).    GetFramesWanted()  Get the number of frames the audio device wants.    Write()  Write samples to audio device.    GetMute()  Gets the audio device mute state.    SetMute()  Sets the audio device mute state.    GetVolumeRange()  Gets the audio device volume range.    GetVolume()  Gets the audio device volume.    SetVolume()  Set audio device volume and mute state.    AddListener()  Adds a listener for volume and mute events.    RemoveListener()  Removes a listener for volume and mute events.

The implementation of the audio driver presents the following options:   If it's buffer-based, this method should block while waiting\nfor a buffer to free up.  In the case of ALSA, the snd_pcm_writei method is blocking.   bool ALSADevice::Write( const uint8_t *buffer, uint32_t bufferSizeInFrames ) {\n   snd_pcm_sframes_t err = snd_pcm_writei(mAudioDeviceHandle, buffer,\nbufferSizeInFrames);\n   if( err   0 )\n      err = snd_pcm_recover(mAudioDeviceHandle, err, 0);\n   if( err   0 )\n      fprintf(stderr,  write to audio interface failed (%s)\\n ,\nsnd_strerror(err));\n   if( err   0   err != (snd_pcm_sframes_t)bufferSizeInFrames )\n      fprintf(stderr,  short write (expected %u, wrote %li)\\n ,\nbufferSizeInFrames, err);\n   return err   0;\n}",

If the field is public then set the \nmode7Public\n bit to 1.\n\n\nDecide whether the field is to be allowed to be configured\nremotely through the Configuration service framework. If the\nfield is updateable, then set the \nmode0Write\n bit to 1.\n   \nNOTE:\n If you set this bit, the field's index must be\n   included in the Persisted or Config keys subsets.\n\n\nDecide whether the field is to be included in the Announcement.\nIf the field is announced then set the \nmode1Announce\n bit to 1.\n   \nNOTE:\n It is recommended to limit the inclusion of a field\n   in the Announcement according to its immediate relevance to\n   the relevant service framework's discovery. Only the value\n   associated with the currentDefaultLanguage will be sent\n   in the Announcement.\n\n\nDecide whether the field is multi-language and add the\nrelevant values for the provisioned languages. If the field\nis multi-language then set the \nmode2MultiLng bit\n to 1.\n\n\nDecide whether the field is to be provisioned dynamically\nin code and persisted during first-time (or post-factory reset)\ndevice startup. If the field is to be initialized once, then\nset the \nmode3Init\n bit to 1 and add the relevant code to initialize it.\n\n\n\n\nRefer to PropertyStore.c \nPropertyStore_Init()\n and\n   \nInitMandatoryPropertiesInRAM()\n for an example setup for the\n   DeviceId and AppId fields.\n\n\nNOTE:\n If you set this bit, the field's index must be included\n   in the Persisted keys subsets.\n\n\n\n\nAdd relevant validation of updated value for your custom key\nby modifying the default implementation of \nIsValueValid()\n in\nConfigSample.c file.\n\n\n\n\nc\n   uint8_t IsValueValid(const char* key, const char* value) {return TRUE;}\n\n\n\n\nAdd entry in corresponding index of propertyStoreDefaultValues\nto provision default value(s).\n\n\nAdd entry in corresponding index of propertyStoreRuntimeValues\nto provision for runtime value(s) buffer(s).\n\n\n\n\nNOTE:\n The example implementation of PropertyStore supports\nproperties with value of type String ('s') only. If your property\nmust be of a different type, you must provision the default value\nas a String and perform the relevant de/serialization on the client side.\n\n\nImplement remote callbacks\n\n\nThe Configuration service framework has the following callbacks\nthat allow for the application writer to react to remote initiated\nevents and updating of configurable values. The prototype of\nthese are defined in ConfigService.h .\n\n\n\n\nRestart-Restart the device or at least its Wi-Fi driver.\n\n\nFactoryReset-Clear persistent values and restore any factory\ndefaults. Optionally, the application developer can mandate a\npower cycle of the device as well.\n\n\nSetPasscode-Persist new device passcode and revoke encryption\nkeys generated from the previous passcode.

Provision the PropertyStore for the Configuration service framework  A PropertyStore structure is required by the ConfigService\nto store the provisioned values for the Config interface data\nfields listed below. See the  Configuration Interface Definition  for more information.  Config interface data fields     Field name  Required  Announced  Type      DefaultLanguage  yes  yes  s    DeviceName  yes  yes  s     PropertyStore implementation  The PropertyStore code is an example PropertyStore implementation\nthat supports the requirements of ConfigService and is included\nin the AppsCommon code.  The PropertyStore uses the provisioning structures that are\ndefined in the PropertyStoreOEMProvisioning.h file in the AppsCommon.\nA provisioning example is provided in the ServerSample code and\nis explained in the  Build an Application using the Thin Library section .  Adding custom field definition and values  Complete the following steps to add your own custom fields.   Decide to which subset the field belongs and add it to\nthe enumeration  AJSVC_PropertyStoreFieldIndices  accordingly.  Add a new field entry at the respective index to the\npropertyStoreProperties.  Decide whether the field is publicly accessible from remote\nclients. If the field is public then set the  mode7Public  bit to 1.  Decide whether the field is to be allowed to be configured\nremotely through the Configuration service framework. If the\nfield is updateable, then set the  mode0Write  bit to 1.\n    NOTE:  If you set this bit, the field's index must be\n   included in the Persisted or Config keys subsets.  Decide whether the field is to be included in the Announcement.\nIf the field is announced then set the  mode1Announce  bit to 1.\n    NOTE:  It is recommended to limit the inclusion of a field\n   in the Announcement according to its immediate relevance to\n   the relevant service framework's discovery. Only the value\n   associated with the currentDefaultLanguage will be sent\n   in the Announcement.  Decide whether the field is multi-language and add the\nrelevant values for the provisioned languages. If the field\nis multi-language then set the  mode2MultiLng bit  to 1.  Decide whether the field is to be provisioned dynamically\nin code and persisted during first-time (or post-factory reset)\ndevice startup. If the field is to be initialized once, then\nset the  mode3Init  bit to 1 and add the relevant code to initialize it.   Refer to PropertyStore.c  PropertyStore_Init()  and\n    InitMandatoryPropertiesInRAM()  for an example setup for the\n   DeviceId and AppId fields.  NOTE:  If you set this bit, the field's index must be included\n   in the Persisted keys subsets.   Add relevant validation of updated value for your custom key\nby modifying the default implementation of  IsValueValid()  in\nConfigSample.c file.   c\n   uint8_t IsValueValid(const char* key, const char* value) {return TRUE;}   Add entry in corresponding index of propertyStoreDefaultValues\nto provision default value(s).  Add entry in corresponding index of propertyStoreRuntimeValues\nto provision for runtime value(s) buffer(s).   NOTE:  The example implementation of PropertyStore supports\nproperties with value of type String ('s') only. If your property\nmust be of a different type, you must provision the default value\nas a String and perform the relevant de/serialization on the client side.  Implement remote callbacks  The Configuration service framework has the following callbacks\nthat allow for the application writer to react to remote initiated\nevents and updating of configurable values. The prototype of\nthese are defined in ConfigService.h .   Restart-Restart the device or at least its Wi-Fi driver.  FactoryReset-Clear persistent values and restore any factory\ndefaults. Optionally, the application developer can mandate a\npower cycle of the device as well.  SetPasscode-Persist new device passcode and revoke encryption\nkeys generated from the previous passcode. Optionally, restart\nthe device as well to cause current sessions to be re-established.  IsValueValid-Validate a given value for a key and a specific language.   The ServerSample code provides the following in the ConfigSample module:   Required callbacks defined in ConfigService.h and provided\nto the service framework in the call to  AJCFG_Start() .  Example implementation of these callbacks in the ConfigSample.c file.   Start the Config server  The Config server is required to be passed the provisioning\nby the application via a call to  AJCFG_Start() .  An example is in  Config_Init()  of ConfigSample.c:  /**\n* Actions to perform when factory reset is requested.\n*/\nstatic AJ_Status FactoryReset() {...}\n/**\n* Actions to perform when a device restart is requested.\n*/\nstatic AJ_Status Restart() {...}\n/**\n* Actions to perform when a new device passcode is set.\n*/\nstatic AJ_Status SetPasscode(const char* daemonRealm, const uint8_t*\nnewPasscode, uint8_t newPasscodeLen) {...}\n/**\n* Check whether the given value is valid for the given key.\n*/\nstatic uint8_t IsValueValid(const char* key, const char* value) {...}\n\nAJ_Status Config_Init()\n{\nAJ_Status status = AJCFG_Start( FactoryReset,  Restart,  SetPasscode, IsValueValid);\nreturn status;\n}  Integrate the Configuration service framework with an application's AuthListener  The Configuration service framework and other AllJoyn service\nframework interface methods and signals require a secure AllJoyn\nconnection. The application writer may choose to use an ALLJOYN_ECDHE_PSK\nauthentication mechanism in its AuthListener implementation.\nThe Configuration service framework enables remote setting\nof a password that can be used as the secret for a key exchange\nauthentication mechanism. An example implementation that uses\nthis facility is included in the sample server application\nin the Services_Handlers.c file as shown below.  uint32_t PasswordCallback(uint8_t* buffer, uint32_t bufLen)\n{\n   AJ_Status status = AJ_OK;\n   const char* hexPassword;\n   size_t hexPasswordLen;\n   uint32_t len = 0;\n\n   hexPassword = AJSVC_PropertyStore_GetValue(AJSVC_PROPERTY_STORE_PASSCODE);\n   if (hexPassword == NULL) { AJ_ErrPrintf(( Password is NULL!\\n )); return len;\n   }\n   AJ_InfoPrintf(( Retrieved password=%s\\n , hexPassword));\n   hexPasswordLen = strlen(hexPassword);\n   len = hexPasswordLen / 2;\n   status = AJ_HexToRaw(hexPassword, hexPasswordLen, buffer, bufLen);\n   if (status == AJ_ERR_RESOURCES) {\n   len = 0;\n   }  The above implementation calls AJSVC_PropertyStore_GetValue\n( AJSVC_PROPERTY_STORE_PASSCODE ) to retrieve the current password.\nThis implementation relies on an extension in the sample\nimplementation of the PropertyStore which was extended with\nthe Passcode field defined in the  AJSCV_PropertyStoreFieldIndices \nenumeration. The field is remotely updateable via a Configuration\nservice framework session using the dedicated  SetPasscode()  method.\nThe stored Passcode is limited to the size of\n65 allowing for 64 characters long secret:  #define PASSWORD_VALUE_LENGTH 65  This is achieved using the field definition that masks the\nfield as writable yet private, as shown in the propertyStoreProperties\ninitialization in PropertyStore.c:  {  Passcode ,   1, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0 }  The default value is provisioned in ServerSample.c as follows:  static const char* DEFAULT_PASSCODES[] = {  303030303030  };\n// HEX encoded { '0', '0', '0', '0', '0', '0' }  and added to propertyStoreDefaultValues.  DEFAULT_PASSCODES,  /*Passcode*/  Since the Passcode enumeration value is less than  AJSVC_PROPERTY_STORE_NUMBER_OF_RUNTIME_KEYS ,\nit is also considered part of the  propertyStoreRuntimeValues ;\nits modified value is persisted.  Also, when  SetPasscode()  is called remotely, the  SetPasscode() \ncallback is invoked with the example implementation in ConfigSample.c file shown below:  static AJ_Status SetPasscode(const char* daemonRealm,\n   const uint8_t* newPasscode, uint8_t newPasscodeLen)\n{\n   AJ_Status status = AJ_OK;\n\n   char newStringPasscode[PASSWORD_VALUE_LENGTH + 1];\n   status = AJ_RawToHex(newPasscode, newPasscodeLen, newStringPasscode,\n      sizeof(newStringPasscode), FALSE);\n   if (status != AJ_OK) {\n      return status;\n   }\n   if (AJSVC_PropertyStore_SetValue(AJSVC_PROPERTY_STORE_REALM_NAME,\n      daemonRealm)   AJSVC_PropertyStore_SetValue(AJSVC_PROPERTY_STORE_PASSCODE,\n      newStringPasscode)) {\n\n      status = AJSVC_PropertyStore_SaveAll();\n      if (status != AJ_OK) {\n         return status;\n      }\n      AJ_ClearCredentials();\n      status = AJ_ERR_READ; //Force disconnect of AJ and services\n         to refresh current sessions\n   } else {\n\n      status = AJSVC_PropertyStore_LoadAll();\n      if (status != AJ_OK) {\n         return status;\n      }\n   }\n\n   return status;\n}  The above implementation stores the passcode as part of the\nPropertyStore persistence:   It calls  AJSVC_ PropertyStore_SetValue(Passcode,\nnewStringPasscode)  to set the value in RAM.  If successful, it also calls  AJSVC_ PropertyStore_SaveAll() \nto persist to NVRAM.  Finally,  AJ_ClearCredentials()  is called to revoke all\ncurrent keys based on the old passcode.   NOTES   The stored passcode is HEX and is limited to the size\nof 32, allowing for 16 bytes long secret:   #define PASSWORD_VALUE_LENGTH (AJ_ADHOC_LEN * 2)   The default value for the Passcode field is provisioned as\n'303030303030' (the HEX encoded string value for the byte array\n{ '0', '0', '0', '0', '0', '0'}) as per the requirement outlined\nin the [Configuration Interface Definition][config-interface-definition.  The realm name is similarly persisted alongside the passcode\nby adding the RealmNamefield index to the  AJSVC_PropertyStoreFieldIndices \nenumeration and provisioning for it in  propertyStoreDefaultValues \nand  propertyStoreRuntimeValues  initialization.   Compile the code  The process to compile varies depending on the host and\ntarget platform. Each host and platform needs may require\na specific directory and file layout, build toolchains,\nprocedures, and supported AllJoyn service frameworks.

It is up to the application developer to add the\nappropriate logic to actually perform the restart.  How to use remote FactoryReset API call  A remote FactoryReset call is propagated to the application\nvia a callback. The ConfigService performs the resetting of\nthe PropertyStore by calling its  resetAll()  method. It is\nup to the application developer to perform other factory reset\ntasks such as clearing the device password and network configuration\n(if any), which are out of the scope of the Configuration service\nframework.  Extending the PropertyStore implementation  The application writer may choose to extend the PropertyStore\nimplementation to manage the device passphrase and network\nconfigurations. This can be done by adding appropriate getters\nand setters and a flag for each property so that the PropertyStore\ninterface call  readAll()  will only return interface/public fields.",

Prior to use of the\nConfiguration service framework as a Config Server or Config Client,\nthe About feature must be implemented and the AllJoyn framework set up.\n\n\nComplete the procedures in the following sections to guide you in this process:\n\n\n\n\nBuilding Android\n\n\nAbout API Guide\n\n\n\n\nImplementing an Application that Uses Config Server\n\n\nImplementing a Config Server requires creating and registering\nan instance of the ConfigService class. Any application using\nConfig Server also requires an About Server to facilitate the\ndiscovery via Announcements.\n\n\nNOTE:\n Verify the BusAttachment has been created, started and\nconnected before implementing the ConfigService. See the\n\nAbout API Guide\n for the code snippets.\nCode in this section references a variable \nmBus\n (the BusAttachment\nvariable name).\n\n\nDeclare listener class\n\n\nDeclare a listener class to receive the \nSessionPortListener\n callback.\n\n\nTypically, an \nAcceptSessionJoiner\n callback in \nSessionPortListener\n\nhas a check to allow or disallow access. Since the AboutService\nrequires access to any application using AboutClient, return\ntrue when this callback is triggered. Use the SessionJoined\nhandler to set the session timeout to 20 seconds.\n\n\nclass MyListener implements SessionPortListener {\n   boolean acceptSessionJoiner( short sessionPort, String joiner, SessionOpts opts ) {\n      return true;\n}\n\n   void sessionJoined( short sessionPort, int id, String joiner ) {\nmBus.enableConcurrentCallbacks();\n      uint32_t timeout = 20;\n      Status status = mBus.SetLinkTimeout(id, timeout);\n   }\n};\n\n\n\n\nBind session port\n\n\nNOTE:\n This step is not mandatory if you are only sending an announcement.\n\n\nTo allow incoming connections, the formation of a session is needed.\nThe AllJoyn framework must be told that connections are allowed.\n\n\nfinal Mutable.ShortValue sPort = new Mutable.ShortValue((short)0);\n\nSessionOpts sessionOpts = new SessionOpts();\nsessionOpts.traffic = SessionOpts.TRAFFIC_MESSAGES;\nsessionOpts.isMultipoint = true;\nsessionOpts.proximity = SessionOpts.PROXIMITY_ANY;\nsessionOpts.transports = SessionOpts.TRANSPORT_ANY;\n\nStatus status = m_bus.bindSessionPort(sPort, sessionOpts, new SessionPortListener()\n   {\n      @Override\n      public boolean acceptSessionJoiner(short sessionPort, String joiner, SessionOpts sessionOpts) {\n         if (sessionPort == sPort.value) {\n            return true;\n         } else {\n            return false;\n         }\n      }\n\n         public void sessionJoined(short sessionPort, int id, String joiner){\n\n            Log.i(TAG,\nString.format(\nSessionPortListener.sessionJoined(%d, %d, %s)\n, sessionPort, id, joiner));\n         }\n      });\n\nString logMessage = String.format(\nBusAttachment.bindSessionPort(%d, %s): %s\n,\nsPort.value, sessionOpts.toString(), status);\nLog.d(TAG, logMessage);\n\n\n\n\nCreate a PropertyStore implementation\n\n\nThe PropertyStore interface is required by the AboutService to\nstore the provisioned values for the About interface data fields.\nSee the \nAbout Interface Definition\n for more information.\n\n\nThe ProperyStore interface is also required by the ConfigService\nto store and facilitate manipulation of some updateable fields\n(listed in [Config interface data fields][config-interface-data-fields.\nSee the [Configuration Interface Definition]\nconfig-interface-definition\n\nfor more information.\n\n\nConfig interface data fields\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nField name\n\n\nRequired\n\n\nSignature\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nDefaultLanguage\n\n\nyes\n\n\ns\n\n\n\n\n\n\nDeviceName\n\n\nyes\n\n\ns\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNOTE:\n Any changes made to these fields should be written to\na shared provisioning file.

Any application using\nConfig Server also requires an About Server to facilitate the\ndiscovery via Announcements.  NOTE:  Verify the BusAttachment has been created, started and\nconnected before implementing the ConfigService. See the About API Guide  for the code snippets.\nCode in this section references a variable  mBus  (the BusAttachment\nvariable name).  Declare listener class  Declare a listener class to receive the  SessionPortListener  callback.  Typically, an  AcceptSessionJoiner  callback in  SessionPortListener \nhas a check to allow or disallow access.

The ProperyStore interface is also required by the ConfigService\nto store and facilitate manipulation of some updateable fields\n(listed in [Config interface data fields][config-interface-data-fields.\nSee the [Configuration Interface Definition] config-interface-definition \nfor more information.

See the  About API Guide \nfor more information.  Sample ConfigStore implementation  An example PropertyStore implementation (ConfigStore)\nis provided below that specifies the following dictionary\nof metadata fields:   Keys are the field names  Values are a Map of String to Object entries where the\nString is the language tag associated with the Object value   This implementation extends the example AboutStore implementation\nin the  About API Guide  and is passed to the\nAboutService instead of AboutStore.  public class ConfigStore implements PropertyStore\n{\n   private Map   String, Map   String, Object     m_DefaultMap = new HashMap  String, Map   String, Object    ();\n   private Set   String   m_AnnounceKeys = new HashSet   String  ();\n   private Set   String     m_WriteableKeys = new HashSet   String  ();\n   private Map   String, Map   String, Object     m_DataMap = new HashMap  \nString, Map   String, Object    ();\n\n   public ConfigStore(Map   String, Map   String, Object     defaultMap)\n   {\n      m_DefaultMap = defaultMap;\n\n      // Initialize set of Announce keys m_AnnounceKeys.add( AppId );\n      m_AnnounceKeys.add( DefaultLanguage );\n      m_AnnounceKeys.add( DeviceName );\n      m_AnnounceKeys.add( DeviceId );\n      m_AnnounceKeys.add( AppName );\n      m_AnnounceKeys.add( Manufacturer );\n      m_AnnounceKeys.add( ModelNumber );\n\n      // Initialize set of Writable keys m_WriteableKeys.add( DefaultLanguage );\n      m_WriteableKeys.add( DeviceName );\n\n      // Load default values loadDefaults();\n\n      // Load override values loadConfigurations();\n   }\n\n   @Override\n   public void readAll(String languageTag, Filter filter, Map String, Object  dataMap)\n         throws PropertyStoreException {\nif (dataMap == null) {\n         throw new\nPropertyStroreException(PropertyStoreException.INVALID_VALUE);\n      }\n      languageTag = checkLanguage(languageTag);\n      for (Entry String, Map String, Object  entry :\nm_DataMap.entrySet()) {\n         if (entry.getValue().containsKey(languageTag))\n         {\n            String lang =  ;\n            if (entry.getValue().containsKey(languageTag)) {\n               lang = languageTag;\n         }\n         switch (filter)\n         {\n         case READ:\n            {\n               dataMap.put(entry.getKey(),\nentry.getValue().get(lang));\n            }\n            break;\n         case ANNOUNCE:\n            if (m_AnnounceKeys.contains(entry.getKey()))\n            {\n               dataMap.put(entry.getKey(),\nentry.getValue().get(lang));\n            }\n            break;\n         case WRITE:\n            if (m_WriteableKeys.contains(entry.getKey()))\n            {\n               dataMap.put(entry.getKey(),\nentry.getValue().get(lang));\n            }\n            break;\n         }\n      }\n   }\n}\n\n@Override\npublic void reset(String key, String languageTag) throws\nPropertyStoreException {\n   languageTag = checkLanguage(languageTag);\n   if (!m_DataMap.containsKey(key)) {\n      throw new PropertyStoreException();\n   }\n   m_DataMap.get(key).remove(languageTag);\nsaveConfigurations();\n   }\n\n@Override\n\npublic void resetAll() throws PropertyStoreException {\n   m_DataMap.clear();\n   loadDefaults();\n}\n\n@Override\npublic void update(String key, String languageTag, Object newValue)\n   throws PropertyStoreException { languageTag = checkLanguage(languageTag);\n   if (!m_DataMap.containsKey(key))\n   {\n      throw new\nPropertyStoreException(PropertyStoreException.INVALID_VALUE);\n   }\n   m_DataMap.get(key).put(languageTag, newValue);\n   saveConfigurations();\n}\n\n   private String checkLanguage(String languageTag) throws\nPropertyStoreException\n   {\n      if (languageTag == null) {\n         throw new\nPropertyStoreException(PropertyStoreException.INVALID_VALUE);\n   }\n      if (languageTag.isEmpty()) {\n         return (String) m_DataMap.get( DefaultLanguage ).get( );\n   }\n   if\n(((Set String )m_DataMap.get( SupportedLanguages ).get( )).contains(languageTa g)) {\n         throw new\nPropertyStoreException(PropertyStoreException.UNSUPPORTED_LANGUAGE);\n   }\n   return languageTag;\n}\n\nprivate void loadDefaults()\n{\n   m_DataMap.putAll(m_DefaultMap);\n}\n\nprivate void loadConfigurations()\n{\n   // Implement your persistence of Config fields here\n}\n\nprivate void saveConfigurations()\n{\n   // Implement your persistence of Config fields here\n\n   }\n}  Provision ConfigStore instance with default values  In the application, the ConfigStore instance which you\ncreated will be loaded with the default values. In the\nsample implementation above, the ConfigStore instance will\nbe provided with a default values map.  Map   String, Map   String, Object   defaultMap = new HashMap   String, Map   String, Object    ();\n// Populate map with fields' names and values.\nMap   String, Object   defaultDeviceName = new HashMap  String, Object ();\ndefaultValue.put( ,  MyDevice );// An empty string means non-language specific field.\ndefaultMap.put( DeviceName , defaultDeviceName);\nMap   String, Object   defaultLanguage = new HashMap  String, Object ();\ndefaultValue.put( ,  en );// An empty string means non-language specific field.\ndefaultMap.put( DefaultLanguage , defaultLanguage);\nMap   String, Object   deviceId = new HashMap  String, Object ();\ndeviceId.put(mBus. getGlobalGUIDString(),  en );\n// An empty string means non- language specific field.\ndefaultMap.put( DeviceId , deviceId);\nPropertyStore aboutStore = new AboutStore(defaultMap);  The following subsections highlight provisioning fields\naccording to their data type.  AppId field  The AppId field is an array of bytes. It is a globally\nunique identifier (GUID) encoded as an array of 16 bytes.  UUID uuid = UUID.randomUUID();\nMap   String, Object   defaultAppId = new HashMap  String, Object ();\ndefaultAppId.put( , TransportUtil.uuidToByteArray(uuid));\ndefaultMap.put( AppId , defaultAppId);  SupportedLanguages field  The SupportedLanguages field is a list of text strings.\nSome fields can have language-dependent value that must\nbe provided for each of the supported languages.  String [] supportedLanguages = {  en ,  fr  };\nMap   String, Object   defaultSupportedLanguages = new HashMap  String, Object ();\ndefaultSupportedLanguages.put( , supportedLanguages);  Non-language-specific fields  Non-language-specific fields support a single supplied\ntext string. Below is an example for the ModelNumber field\non how to insert into the ConfigStore. The code below can be\nused with the field name being replaced by other field names\nlisted in  Config interface data fields .  Map   String, Object   defaultModelNumber = new HashMap  String, Object ();\ndefaultModelNumber.put( ,  MN-123 ); );// An empty string means non-language specific field.\ndefaultMap.put( ModelNumber , defaultModelNumber);  Language-dependent fields  Language-dependent fields support a single supplied text string.\nBelow is an example for the Description field on how to insert\ninto the PropertyStore. The code below can be used with the field\nname being replaced by other field names listed in Config interface data fields .  Map   String, Object   defaultDescription = new HashMap  String, Object ();\ndefaultDescription.put( en ,  The description in English );\ndefaultDescription.put( fr ,  La description en francais );\ndefaultMap.put( AppId , defaultDescription);  Establish the AboutService in Server mode  For an application to provide Config Server, it requires to\nAnnounce its interface via an About Server. AboutServiceImpl\nis an implementation wrapper around AllJoyn native calls that\nhandle the interactions between About Server and About Client.\nFor more details, see the content in  Provision PropertyStore instance\nwith default values  through  Send the Announcement \nin the  About API Guide .

ConfigServiceImpl is an\nimplementation wrapper around AllJoyn native calls that handle\nthe interactions with the Config Server.  ConfigService configService = ConfigServiceImpl.getInstance();  Start Server mode  Perform the following tasks to start Server mode.  Implement application callbacks  Before starting in server mode, a few application callbacks\nmust be implemented that allow reaction to changes in various\nfield values.  ConfigChangeListener configChangeListener = new ConfigChangeListener()\n{\n   @Override\n   public void onConfigChanged(Map String, Variant  newConfiguration, String languageTag)\n   {\n      // Perform any action that depends on configuration value changes. E.g. propagate a changed DeviceName to other services that may consume it.\n   }\n   @Override\n   public void onResetConfiguration(String language, String[] fieldNames)\n   {\n      // Perform any action that depends on configuration value changes. E.g. propagate a reset DeviceName to other services that may consume it.\n   }\n};\nRestartHandler restartHandler = new RestartHandler()\n{\n   @Override\n   public void restart()\n   {\n      // Restart application disconnecting and reconnecting to the\nAllJoyn network.\n   }\n};\nFactoryResetHandler factoryResetHandler = new FactoryResetHandler()\n{\n   public void doFactoryReset()\n   {\n      configStore.resetAll(); // Reset the ConfigStore restoring default factory values.\n         // Perform any other reset logic related to the AllJoyn services\nplatform.\n   }\n}\nPassphraseChangedListener passphraseChangeListener = new\nPassphraseChangedListener()\n{\n   public void onPassphraseChanged(byte[] passphrase)\n   {\n      // Perform any other passphrase change logic related to the application.\n   }\n}  Start the ConfigService in Server mode  Once the callbacks are initialized, the Configuration service\nframework can be started. Register the relevant BusObjects,\nadd the relevant interfaces to the Announcement's ObjectDescription\nand register the callbacks.  configService.startConfigServer(aboutStore, configChangeListener,\nrestartHandler, factoryResetHandler, passphraseChangeListener, mBus);  Register SetPasswordHandler  A SetPasswordHandler is required to be registered with the\nConfigService in order to handler remote calls to set a new\npassword as the secret for the key exchange encryption mechanism.  SetPasswordHandler setPasswordHandler = new SetPasswordHandler() {\n   @Override\n   public void setPassword(String peerName, char[] password)\n   {\n      // Store new credentials\n      // Clear all current encryption keys that were generated from the current passphrase.\n      mBus.clearKeyStore();\n   }\n};\nconfigService.setSetPasswordHandler(setPasswordHandler);  Advertise to allow connections  mBus.advertiseName(mBus.getUniqueName());  Send the Announcement  aboutService.announce();  Unregister and delete ConfigService and BusAttachment  When your process is done with the ConfigService and no\nlonger wishes to send announcements, unregister the process\nfrom the AllJoyn bus and then delete variables used.  if( configService != null ) {\n   configService.stopServer();\n}\nif( aboutService != null ) {\n   aboutService.stopServer();\n}\nif( mBus != null) {\n   mBus.disconnect();\n   mBus.release();\n   mBus = null;\n}",

Additionally, included in the sample component\nis a sample application that implements the Control Panel service\nframework and contains a simple control panel with one example for\neach kind of Widget.     Components  Description      Control Panel Service  This includes three parts: Widgets, Common, and Main, each with their own modules which together make up the service and allow for interaction between Controllees and Controllers.    Control Panel Provided  Code specific to the Controllee that will handle requests from Controllers to set property values, get property values, and/or execute actions. Additionally it can initiate a refresh on the Controller by calling the Control Panel service framework's appropriate functions. This is device-specific code created by the OEM.    Control Panel Generator  A Generator tool that accepts an XML UI definition file, containing the Widgets and their properties that describe the specific Controllee's control panel and generate code into a Control Panel Generated code.    Control Panel Generated  Code generated using the Control Panel Generator. This code ties together the Control Panel Service and the Control Panel Provided code.    Control Panel Sample  A template for an application. This component is responsible for the general flow of the Controllee application including initialization, shutdown, and passing on incoming message to the ControlPanelService module.     Control Panel Service component  Widget modules     Module  Description      ContainerWidget  Container UI element. Allows grouping of widgets together. Must contain at least one child element.    LabelWidget  UI element that functions as a read only label of text.    ActionWidget  UI element represented by a button that either executes code on the Controllee, or opens a Dialog Widget as a confirmation before executing.    DialogWidget  UI dialog element. Has a dialog message and up to 3 choices of buttons.    PropertyWidget  UI element used to display a value and possibly edit it.     Common modules     Module  Description      BaseWidget  Base module used by all the Widget modules.    ConstraintList  Module used when defining a constraint list for a property value.    ConstraintRange  Module used when defining a constraint range for a property value.    ControlMarshalUtil  Utility functions used to marshal control panel properties.    DateTimeUtil  Module that enables properties that have a Date or Time value.    HttpControl  Module that allows publicizing of a URL to function as a control panel for the Controllee.     General modules     Module  Description      ControlPanelInterface  The definitions of all ControlPanel Service interfaces.    ControlPanelService  Handler of all interactions between Controllers and Controllees. The application delegates incoming messages to this module for processing and handling. The actual handling is specific to the generated code.     Control Panel Provided component  This component contains the code specific to the device that\nthe Controllee application runs on. The Control Panel Generated\ncode will interact with this component to do the following:   Set property values  Get property values  Execute actions   Additionally, it can initiate a refresh on the Controller by\ncalling the Control Panel service framework's appropriate functions.\nThe modules in this component are provided by a third party.  For example, think of a washing machine. The Control Panel\nProvided component would be the code that communicates with\nthe hardware to perform actions such as setting the water\ntemperature or starting the wash cycle.  Control Panel Generator component  Control Panel Generator modules     Module  Description      PreGenFiles  Files used as a template for the ultimately generated files.    Cp.xsd and cpvalidate  As part of the generation the XML undergoes two validation steps. Validate against an XSD to verify all tags and their content are correctly defined. Validate to verify that all the required fields needed to display the widgets in the XML graphically are properly defined.    SampleXMLS  Collection of XML files that can be viewed as samples.    GeneratorScript  Python scripts that generate the code. For steps on how to generate the code, see  Start the Controllee .     Control Panel Generated component  Control Panel Generated modules     Module  Description      ControlPanelGenerated  The Generated files, created by the generator using the given XML.     Control Panel Sample component  Control Panel Sample modules     Module  Description      ControlPanelSample  The module responsible for the generalflow of the Controllee application including initialization and shutdown of the ControlPanelService module, and related business logic when the application's message loop is idling.

This is the service layer and\ndoes not have any application-specific code.\n\n\nWidget modules\n\n\nThe following widget modules are contained in the Control\nPanel Service component used to create a ControlPanel.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nModule\n\n\nDescription\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nContainer\n\n\nContainer UI element. Allows grouping of widgets together. Must contain at least one child element.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nLabel\n\n\nUI element that functions as a read only label of text.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAction\n\n\nUI element represented by a button that either executes code on the Controllee, or opens a Dialog Widget as a confirmation before executing.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nDialog\n\n\nUI dialog element. Has a dialog message and up to 3 choices of buttons.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nProperty\n\n\nUI element used to display a value and possibly edit it.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nControl Panel Provided component\n\n\nThis component contains the code specific to the device that\nthe Controllee application runs on. The Control Panel Generated\ncode will interact with this component to do the following:\n\n\n\n\nSet property values\n\n\nGet property values\n\n\nExecute actions.\n\n\n\n\nAdditionally, it can initiate a refresh on the Controller by\ncalling the Control Panel service framework's appropriate functions.\nThe modules in this component are provided by a third party.\n\n\nFor example, think of a washing machine. The Control Panel\nProvided component would be the code that communicates with\nthe hardware to perform actions such as setting the water\ntemperature or starting the wash cycle.\n\n\nControl Panel Generator component\n\n\nA Generator tool that accepts an XML UI definition file,\ncontaining the Widgets and their properties that describe the\nspecific Controllee's control panel and generate code into a\nControl Panel Generated code. For steps on how to generate the\ncode, see \nRun the Code Generator tool\n.\n\n\nControl Panel Sample component\n\n\nThis component is a template for an application, and responsible\nfor the general flow of the Controllee application including\ninitialization and shutdown. It relies on the generated and the provided code.\n\n\nBuild a Controllee\n\n\nThe following steps provide the high-level process to build a Controllee.\n\n\n\n\nCreate the base for the AllJoyn application.\n\n\nImplement the ProperyStore and use this with the AboutService\nin server mode. See the \nAbout API Guide\n for instructions.\n\n\nCreate the code handlers necessary to control the device.\nThis includes getters and setters for properties and functions\nto handle execution of actions.\n\n\nCreate the XML definition of the UI. Include calls to the\ncode handlers in the appropriate places.\n\n\nUse the code generation tool provided in the SDK to generate\ncode from XML.\n\n\nInitialize the Control Panel Service and the Controllee.\nSend an announcement to broadcast the available controlpanels.\n\n\n\n\nImplementing a Controllee\n\n\nInitialize the AllJoyn framework\n\n\nSee the \nBuilding Linux\n section for\ninstructions to set up the AllJoyn framework.\n\n\nCreate bus attachment\n\n\nBusAttachment* bus = CommonSampleUtil::prepareBusAttachment();\n\n\n\n\nStart the AboutService in server mode\n\n\nThe Control Panel service framework depends on the About feature.\n\n\nFor more information about the About feature, see the\n\nAbout API Guide\n.\n\n\nCreate a PropertyStore and fill it with the needed values\n\n\npropertyStore = new AboutPropertyStoreImpl();; propertyStore-\nsetDeviceName(deviceName); propertyStore-\nsetAppId(appIdHex); propertyStore-\nsetAppName(appName); std::vector\nqcc::String\n languages(3); languages[0] = \nen\n;\nlanguages[1] = \nsp\n;\nlanguages[2] = \nfr\n;\npropertyStore-\nsetSupportedLangs(languages);\npropertyStore-\nsetDefaultLang(defaultLanguage);\n\n   DeviceNamesType::const_iterator iter = deviceNames.find(languages[0]);\n   if (iter != deviceNames.end()) {\n      CHECK_RETURN(propertyStore-\nsetDeviceName(iter-\nsecond.c_str(), languages[0]));\n   } else {\n      CHECK_RETURN(propertyStore-\nsetDeviceName(\nMy device name\n, \nen\n));\n   }\n\n   iter = deviceNames.find(languages[1]);\n   if (iter != deviceNames.end()) {\n      CHECK_RETURN(propertyStore-\nsetDeviceName(iter-\nsecond.c_str(), languages[1]));\n   } else {\n      CHECK_RETURN(propertyStore-\nsetDeviceName(\nMi nombre de dispositivo\n,\n\nsp\n));\n   }\n\n   iter = deviceNames.find(languages[2]);\n   if (iter != deviceNames.end()) {\n      CHECK_RETURN(propertyStore-\nsetDeviceName(iter-\nsecond.c_str(), languages[2]));\n   } else {\n      CHECK_RETURN(propertyStore-\nsetDeviceName(\nMon nom de l'appareil\n, \nfr\n));\n\n   }\n\n\n\n\nImplement a BusListener and SessionPortListener\n\n\nIn order to bind a SessionPort and accept sessions, a new\nclass must be created that inherits from the AllJoyn BusListener\nand SessionPortListener classes.\n\n\nThe class must contain the following function:\n\n\nbool AcceptSessionJoiner(SessionPort sessionPort,\n   const char* joiner, const SessionOpts\n opts)\n\n\n\n\nThe AcceptSessionJoiner function will be called any time a\njoinsession request is received; the Listener class needs\nto dictate whether the joinsession request should be accepted\nor rejected by returning true or false, respectively.\nThese considerations are application-specific and can\ninclude any of the following:\n\n\n\n\nThe SessionPort the request was made on\n\n\nSpecific SessionOpts limitations\n\n\nThe number of sessions already joined.\n\n\n\n\nHere is an example of a full class declaration for the listener class.\n\n\nclass CommonBusListener : public ajn::BusListener,\n   public ajn::SessionPortListener\n{\n\n   public: CommonBusListener();\n      ~CommonBusListener();\n      bool AcceptSessionJoiner(ajn::SessionPort sessionPort,\n         const char* joiner, const ajn::SessionOpts\n opts);\n      void setSessionPort(ajn::SessionPort sessionPort);\n      ajn::SessionPort getSessionPort();\n   private:\n      ajn::SessionPort m_SessionPort;\n};\n\n\n\n\nInstantiate a BusListener and initialize the About feature\n\n\nbusListener = new CommonBusListener();\nAboutServiceApi::Init(*bus, *propertyStore);\nAboutServiceApi* aboutService = AboutServiceApi::getInstance();\n\nbusListener-\nsetSessionPort(port);\nbus-\nRegisterBusListener(*busListener);\nTransportMask transportMask = TRANSPORT_ANY;\nSessionPort sp = port;\nSessionOpts opts(SessionOpts::TRAFFIC_MESSAGES, false,\n   SessionOpts::PROXIMITY_ANY, transportMask);\nbus-\nBindSessionPort(sp, opts, *busListener);\naboutService-\nRegister(port);\nbus-\nRegisterBusObject(*aboutService);\n\n\n\n\nInitialize the Control Panel service and the Controllee\n\n\nControlPanelService* controlPanelService = ControlPanelService::getInstance();\nControlPanelControllee* controlPanelControllee = 0;\nControlPanelGenerated::PrepareWidgets(controlPanelControllee);\ncontrolPanelService-\ninitControllee(bus, controlPanelControllee);\n\n\n\n\nSend an Announcement\n\n\nAboutServiceApi* aboutService = AboutServiceApi::getInstance();\naboutService-\nAnnounce();\n\n\n\n\nCreate header file that declares device specific callbacks\n\n\nCallback signature for GetCode of property\n\n\nuint16_t getTemperature() - Returns the property value.\ndataType is specific to the applications needs\n\n\n\n\nCallback for SetCode property\n\n\nThis signature is not determined by the Control Panel service\nframework and can be chosen based on the specific application's\nneed.

Control Panel Service components  Components that allow for interaction between Controllees and\nControllers are defined below. This is the service layer and\ndoes not have any application-specific code.  Widget modules  The following widget modules are contained in the Control\nPanel Service component used to create a ControlPanel.     Module  Description      Container  Container UI element. Allows grouping of widgets together. Must contain at least one child element.    Label  UI element that functions as a read only label of text.    Action  UI element represented by a button that either executes code on the Controllee, or opens a Dialog Widget as a confirmation before executing.    Dialog  UI dialog element. Has a dialog message and up to 3 choices of buttons.    Property  UI element used to display a value and possibly edit it.     Control Panel Provided component  This component contains the code specific to the device that\nthe Controllee application runs on. The Control Panel Generated\ncode will interact with this component to do the following:   Set property values  Get property values  Execute actions.   Additionally, it can initiate a refresh on the Controller by\ncalling the Control Panel service framework's appropriate functions.\nThe modules in this component are provided by a third party.  For example, think of a washing machine. The Control Panel\nProvided component would be the code that communicates with\nthe hardware to perform actions such as setting the water\ntemperature or starting the wash cycle.  Control Panel Generator component  A Generator tool that accepts an XML UI definition file,\ncontaining the Widgets and their properties that describe the\nspecific Controllee's control panel and generate code into a\nControl Panel Generated code. For steps on how to generate the\ncode, see  Run the Code Generator tool .  Control Panel Sample component  This component is a template for an application, and responsible\nfor the general flow of the Controllee application including\ninitialization and shutdown. It relies on the generated and the provided code.  Build a Controllee  The following steps provide the high-level process to build a Controllee.   Create the base for the AllJoyn application.  Implement the ProperyStore and use this with the AboutService\nin server mode. See the  About API Guide  for instructions.  Create the code handlers necessary to control the device.\nThis includes getters and setters for properties and functions\nto handle execution of actions.  Create the XML definition of the UI. Include calls to the\ncode handlers in the appropriate places.  Use the code generation tool provided in the SDK to generate\ncode from XML.  Initialize the Control Panel Service and the Controllee.\nSend an announcement to broadcast the available controlpanels.",

The class must contain the following function:  bool AcceptSessionJoiner(SessionPort sessionPort,\n   const char* joiner, const SessionOpts  opts)  The AcceptSessionJoiner function will be called any time a\njoinsession request is received; the Listener class needs\nto dictate whether the joinsession request should be accepted\nor rejected by returning true or false, respectively.\nThese considerations are application-specific and can\ninclude any of the following:   The SessionPort the request was made on  Specific SessionOpts limitations  The number of sessions already joined.   Here is an example of a full class declaration for the listener class.  class CommonBusListener : public ajn::BusListener,\n   public ajn::SessionPortListener\n{\n\n   public: CommonBusListener();\n      ~CommonBusListener();\n      bool AcceptSessionJoiner(ajn::SessionPort sessionPort,\n         const char* joiner, const ajn::SessionOpts  opts);\n      void setSessionPort(ajn::SessionPort sessionPort);\n      ajn::SessionPort getSessionPort();\n   private:\n      ajn::SessionPort m_SessionPort;\n};  Instantiate a BusListener and initialize the About feature  busListener = new CommonBusListener();\nAboutServiceApi::Init(*bus, *propertyStore);\nAboutServiceApi* aboutService = AboutServiceApi::getInstance();\n\nbusListener- setSessionPort(port);\nbus- RegisterBusListener(*busListener);\nTransportMask transportMask = TRANSPORT_ANY;\nSessionPort sp = port;\nSessionOpts opts(SessionOpts::TRAFFIC_MESSAGES, false,\n   SessionOpts::PROXIMITY_ANY, transportMask);\nbus- BindSessionPort(sp, opts, *busListener);\naboutService- Register(port);\nbus- RegisterBusObject(*aboutService);  Initialize the Control Panel service and the Controllee  ControlPanelService* controlPanelService = ControlPanelService::getInstance();\nControlPanelControllee* controlPanelControllee = 0;\nControlPanelGenerated::PrepareWidgets(controlPanelControllee);\ncontrolPanelService- initControllee(bus, controlPanelControllee);  Send an Announcement  AboutServiceApi* aboutService = AboutServiceApi::getInstance();\naboutService- Announce();  Create header file that declares device specific callbacks  Callback signature for GetCode of property  uint16_t getTemperature() - Returns the property value.\ndataType is specific to the applications needs  Callback for SetCode property  This signature is not determined by the Control Panel service\nframework and can be chosen based on the specific application's\nneed.

For example:  void SetTemperature(uint16 newTemperature);  Callback for code execution of action  This signature is not determined by the Control Panel service\nframework and can be chosen based on the specific application's need.

Start the AboutService in client mode  The Control Panel service framework depends on the About feature.  For more information about the About feature, see the  About API Guide .  Initialize the About feature  aboutClient = AboutServiceImpl.getInstance();\naboutClient.startAboutClient(bus);  Listen for announcements from Controllee devices  Register an announcement handler to receive announcements\nfrom the About feature.  aboutClient.addAnnouncementHandler(announcementHandler,\nnew String[] {  org.alljoyn.ControlPanel.*  });  For each announcement that is received, check if it implements\nthe ControlPanel interface. If it does, save it as a controllable\ndevice for later use.  @Override\npublic void onAnnouncement(String busName, short port, BusObjectDescription[]\nobjectDescriptions, Map String, Variant  aboutMap) {\n   Variant varDeviceId = aboutMap.get(AboutKeys.ABOUT_DEVICE_ID);\n   String devIdSig  = VariantUtil.getSignature(varDeviceId);\n   if ( !devIdSig.equals( s ) ) {\n      return;\n   }\n   deviceId = varDeviceId.getObject(String.class);\n   // get the device name from the annoucement just as the device id above\n\n   for(int i = 0; i   objectDescriptions.length; ++i){\n      BusObjectDescription description = objectDescriptions[i];\n      String[] supportedInterfaces  = description.getInterfaces();\n      for(int j = 0; j   supportedInterfaces.length; ++j){\n      if(supportedInterfaces[j].startsWith\n         ( org.alljoyn.ControlPanel )){\n         // found a control panel interface\n         if (deviceContext == null) {\n            deviceContext = new DeviceContext\n         (deviceId, busName, deviceName);\n}    deviceContext.addObjectInterfaces\n(description.getPath(), supportedInterfaces);\n         }\n      }\n   }\n}  Get the controllable device  Once a controllable device is detected via the announcement,\nget its ControllableDevice proxy object.  The ControllableDevice is used to later create a session\nwith the Controllee.  controllableDevice = ControlPanelService.getInstance()\n   .getControllableDevice(deviceContext.deviceId, deviceContext.busName);  Start a session with the Controllee  To get the control panels of a Controllee, you must create a\nsession with it. This is an asynchronous call and requires a\nDeviceEventsListener as a callback.  controllableDevice.startSession(DeviceEventsListener);  Listen for a sessionEstablished event to verify the session\nwas established successfully. When a session is established,\na collection of control panel containers is received.  NOTE:  There may be more than one control panel container, each\nintended for a different use. For example, one for the home user\nand another for a technician. Each element of the container is a\nDeviceControlPanel and provided per language.  @Override\npublic void sessionEstablished(ControllableDevice device,\n   Collection ControlPanelCollection  controlPanelContainer)\n{\n   //At this point the session was established\n}  Implement the DeviceEventsListeners  There are other methods of the DeviceEventsListener\n(besides for sessionEstablished) that should be implemented\nto receive session-related events from the Control Panel\nservice framework.  public void sessionLost(ControllableDevice device);\n\npublic void errorOccured(ControllableDevice device, String reason);  For more information, refer to the API documentation.  Get a device control panel  Get a collection of device control panels and select the one\nwith the desired language.

The root container element is the top-level UI element that\ncontains all the child UI elements of the selected DeviceControlPanel.  Detect the type of the root container. It may be either a ContainerWidget\nor an AlertDialogWidget (mostly used for notification with action).  UIElement rootContainerElement =\n   deviceControlPanel.getRootElement(ControlPanelEventsListener);\nUIElementType elementType = rootContainerElement.getElementType();  Implement the ControlPanelEventsListener  The ControlPanelEventsListener interface should be implemented\nto receive changes that occurred in the control panel on the\nControllee and should be reflected on the UI accordingly.  public void valueChanged(DeviceControlPanel panel, UIElement uielement, Object newValue);\n\npublic void metadataChanged(DeviceControlPanel panel, UIElement uielement);\n\npublic void notificationActionDismiss(DeviceControlPanel panel);\n\npublic void errorOccured(DeviceControlPanel panel, String reason);  For more information, refer to the API documentation.  Build the Android UI elements  The Adapter loops through the UI elements list, received from\nthe root container, and builds a linear layout with all the\ncontained Android views.  The application can embed this inside an activity.

            "text": "AllJoyn\n Transports Best Practices\n\n\nIntroduction\n\n\nTransports are based on ISO OSI layer 4 - transport layer - mechanisms.\nSuch transport mechanisms are typically optimized for some set\nof operating characteristics or network environments. The resulting\noptimizations and environments in the layer 4 transport mechanism\nwill result in different qualities being presented by AllJoyn Transports\nthat use them.\n\n\nIn order to be called an AllJoyn Transport, all Transports must provide\nthe same capabilities, however, since the underlying mechanisms provide\ndifferencing amounts of support for various functions, some layer 4\ntransports, and therefore AllJoyn Transports will be more suitable\nto some distributed applications.\n\n\nThis document discusses how to determine which AllJoyn Transports\nmight be more suitable than others to different application traffic\npatterns and requirements.\n\n\nAllJoyn Transports\n\n\nOne of the fundamental abstractions in an AllJoyn system is that\nof a Transport. An AllJoyn Transport provides an abstract\nrepresentation of a collection of underlying mechanisms\nthat provides four basic functions  :\n\n\n\n\nThe ability to discover remote AllJoyn Bus Attachments or Interfaces\n\n\nThe ability to advertise local AllJoyn Bus Attachments to\nthe greater AllJoyn system\n\n\nThe ability to establish traffic flows to other AllJoyn devices\n\n\nThe ability to move AllJoyn Messages (representing Method Calls,\nMethod Replies or Signals) between devices.\n\n\n\n\nIn the ISO OSI seven-layer model, the transport layer is\nresponsible for moving data sequences from one host to another\nand maintaining appropriate transport-specific qualities of\nservice. One measure of quality of service, for example, is\nreliable and ordered delivery of data. TCP and UDP both move\ndata sequences from one host to another, and have different\nquality of service guarantees. TCP provides reliable, ordered\nbyte streams; and UDP provides datagram services with no\nguarantee of ordering or reliable delivery. TCP and UDP are\nthus both transport layer (layer 4) protocols in the ISO OSI model.\n\n\nAllJoyn Transports make use of lower-level OS services like TCP\nor UDP in order to manage the actual movement of data sequences,\nand therefore sit above layer 4 in the OSI protocol stack.\nSince the AllJoyn Transport manages underlying connections\non behalf of the application layer (layer 7) the concept of\nAllJoyn Transport most closely matches the session layer\n(layer 5) of the ISO OSI model.\n\n\nAllJoyn Messaging\n\n\nThe AllJoyn Message layer, which is responsible for marshaling\nand unmarshaling of Signals and Method Calls, can be thought\nof as residing in the presentation layer (layer 6) of the ISO OSI model;\nand the routing functionality of the AllJoyn Routing Node\ncan be thought of as lying above AllJoyn Transports (still in layer 5),\nbut below the Message layer at layer 6.\n\n\nIn the following figure, notice that the AllJoyn Bus Attachment\ncorresponds to the application layer in the seven-layer model\nin that it provides the interface between the network stack\nand the application itself. Bus Attachments provide functionality\nrequired by the application to create, marshal and unmarshal\nAllJoyn Messages. This functionality corresponds to translating\nbetween application and network data formats and therefore\ncorresponds to the presentation layer in the seven-layer model.\n\n\n\n\nFigure:\n Mapping of AllJoyn system and OSI layer transports\n\n\nAllJoyn Messages are sent to a local Routing Node which is\nresponsible for selecting an AllJoyn Transport over which\na given Message must be sent. AllJoyn Transports are responsible\nfor controlling the dialogs between computers and therefore\ncorrespond to the session layer of the seven-layer model.\nMessages are sent to an OSI transport layer mechanism,\nfor example TCP or UDP, with suitable guarantees of service.\nThe transport layer passes byte streams or datagrams to the\nnetwork layer   and then down to the 802.11 MAC and PHY\nin the figure.\n\n\nSupported AllJoyn transports\n\n\nSince an AllJoyn Transport encapsulates the functions of\nmoving data sequences, connections, and advertisement and\ndiscovery, there are separate AllJoyn Transports for separate\nunderlying mechanisms. For example, the AllJoyn TCP Transport\nuses TCP/IP as the mechanism for moving data between Routing Nodes;\nthe AllJoyn UDP Transport uses UDP/IP as the mechanism; the\nAllJoyn Bluetooth (BT) Transport does the same for Bluetooth\nconnections, and the AllJoyn Local Transport uses UNIX domain sockets.\n\n\nOften, the name given to an AllJoyn Transport echoes the method\nused in the underlying OSI layer 4 mechanism. For example, the\nAllJoyn TCP transport uses TCP/IP to move bits from one host\nto another; the AllJoyn UDP Transport uses UDP/IP to actually move bits.\n\n\nAllJoyn applications may select the AllJoyn Transport that is\nactually used by choosing one or more TransportMask bits in\nappropriate AllJoyn APIs. The currently defined TransportMask\nbits are listed in the following table.\n\n\nAllJoyn TransportMask definition\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTransport name\n\n\nValue\n\n\nDescription\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTRANSPORT_NONE\n\n\n0x0000\n\n\nNo transport.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTRANSPORT_LOCAL\n\n\n0x0001\n\n\nThe local transport.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTRANSPORT_BLUETOOTH\n\n\n0x0002\n\n\nBluetooth transport.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTRANSPORT_WLAN\n\n\n0x0004\n\n\nWireless local area network transport.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTRANSPORT_WWAN\n\n\n0x0008\n\n\nWireless wide area network transport (not supported).\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTRANSPORT_LAN\n\n\n0x0010\n\n\nWired local area network transport.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTRANSPORT_ICE\n\n\n0x0020\n\n\nICE (Interactive Connectivity Establishment) transport (not supported).\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTRANSPORT_WFD\n\n\n0x0080\n\n\nWi-Fi Direct transport (not supported).\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTRANSPORT_ANY\n\n\n0xFFFF \n ~TRANSPORT_WFD\n\n\nAny transport except Wi-Fi Direct.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nCurrently, the AllJoyn system's WLAN and LAN transports are\nsupported by a single underlying TCP transport.\n\n\nRouting node transport\n\n\nEach transport establishes and maintains connectivity based on\nthe underlying physical transport it supports. Based on the\ntype of underlying physical transport, the actual connectivity\nbetween two routing nodes in an AllJoyn network can be either\nsingle-hop or multi-hop. An AllJoyn distributed bus is an\noverlay network whose topology does not necessarily map directly\nto the topology of the underlying network. If an application\nhas no preference, it can provide TRANSPORT_ANY and allow the\nAllJoyn system to determine which transport to use.\n\n\nThe most commonly used Routing Node-to-Routing Node transports\nin the AllJoyn system are based on the IP family of transport\nmechanisms: TCP/IP and UDP/IP. These ISO layer 3 and 4 mechanisms\nare almost universally supported across the AllJoyn platforms\nof interest. Although from a high-level perspective, they\naccomplish the same objectives, at closer examination the\ngo about things slightly differently and therefore have different\nstrengths and weaknesses.\n\n\nTCP\n\n\nTCP and UDP are fairly complementary protocols, which is why\nthey are both present in the IP stack. TCP is a relatively\ncomplicated connection-based protocol that allows applications\nto send data reliably from one side to another. If data is\nlost, it is retransmitted automatically by TCP. The transmitted\ndata is stream-based which means that it is sent and received\nas a sequence of bytes that are arbitrarily (from the point\nof view of the sender) broken up into network packets.\nIn order to operate over the wider Internet, streams of TCP data\nare flow-controlled and TCP uses congestion-avoidance mechanisms\nto prevent congestion collapse in the presence of (many) multiple streams.\n\n\nUDP\n\n\nUDP, on the other hand, is a simple, high-speed \"wrapper\" around\nthe lower-level network layer (IP) functions provided to move data.\nUDP is inherently connectionless and data is sent in so-called\ndatagrams which are discrete \"packages\". UDP is not a connection-based\nprotocol; nor does it provide any reliability guarantees. There is\nno flow control nor is there congestion avoidance functionality present in UDP.\n\n\nThese low-level transport characteristics percolate up into the\ncorresponding AllJoyn Transports which take advantage of those\ncharacteristics to more efficiently accomplish the goals of applications.\n\n\nSince underlying layer 4 mechanisms can provide very different\nqualities of service, one should infer that the choice of\nAllJoyn TransportMask, and therefore Transport, can have significant\neffects on the quality of service of an AllJoyn Message flow.\nMaking such choices effectively is the subject of the remainder\nof this document.\n\n\nTransportMask\n\n\nAs shown in \nAllJoyn TransportMask definition\n,\na number of TransportMask-related symbols are defined as of\nthis writing. It is the case (for historical reasons) that although\nthey are associated with different bits, the symbols TRANSPORT_TCP,\nTRANSPORT_WLAN, TRANSPORT_WWAN, TRANSPORT_LAN all refer to the\nAllJoyn TCP Transport. It is recommended that only the symbols\nTRANSPORT_TCP be used to refer to the AllJoyn TCP Transport in\norder to minimize confusion. TRANSPORT_NONE is simply a constant\ndefined to be none of the transports, which isn't particularly useful.\nThe Wi-Fi Direct Transport (TRANSPORT_WFD) is not currently supported.\nThe implication is that only the following TransportMask definitions\nshould be used to refer to specific AllJoyn Transports:\n\n TRANSPORT_TCP\n\n TRANSPORT_UDP\n\n\nRecommendation 1\n\n\n\n\nDo not refer specifically to transports that are present for\nhistorical reasons such as TRANSPORT_WLAN, TRANSPORT_WWAN, or\nTRANSPORT_LAN; neither refer to currently unsupported transports\nsuch as TRNSPORT_WFD. Instead, prefer currently defined transports --\nTRANSPORT_TCP or TRANSPORT_UDP.\n\n\n\n\nAs mentioned above, symbols defining groups of transports are also provided:\n\n\n\n\nTRANSPORT_IP - Describes both TRANSPORT_TCP and TRANSPORT_UDP\n\n\nTRANSPORT_ANY - Refers to all currently defined transports\nthat are not considered experimental.\n\n\nTRANSPORT_ALL - It is not recommended to use TRANSPORT_ALL\nunless there is a specific need to include all experimental\nAllJoyn Transports.\n\n\n\n\nMore typically, one would include specific experimental transports\non an as-needed basis.\n\n\nIf there is no need to select an AllJoyn Transport in order\nto take advantage of some specific quality of service, one\nwould pass TRANSPORT_ANY to all advertisement-, discovery-\nand session-related APIs. As a result, the AllJoyn Transport\nselected by an AllJoyn application is on a first-discovered\nbasis. That is, the first advertisement that happens to be\nreceived is the one that will drive the selection of transport.\nPresumably this is fine since by selecting TRANSPORT_ANY both\nthe advertising and discovering Bus Attachment are effectively\ndeclaring that \"anything I discover is fine\".\n\n\nRecommendation 2\n\n\n\n\nIf the primary concern of a distributed application is the\nability to connect, that is, when neither the client nor the\nservice side of a communicating pair of Bus Attachments has\nany particular quality of service guarantee, prefer TRANSPORT_ANY\nand simply join a Session to the Bus Attachment corresponding\nto the first advertisement received.\n\n\n\n\nDepending on the availability of AllJoyn Transport, this choice\nmay result in the selection of a very high-speed IP-based Transport\nsuch as TCP or UDP. It may also result in a communication link\nover a personal area network connection which may be relatively slow.\nSince the overriding goal is communication irrespective of\nmechanism, such choices are presumed to be appropriate.\n\n\nIn order to make any more meaningful choices, one must understand\nsome of the qualities of the existing AllJoyn Transports\nwhich might affect such a choice.\n\n\nHomogeneous Multipoint Sessions\n\n\nOne of the connectivity options in the AllJoyn system is that of a\nmultipoint Session.  This option allows clients to send AllJoyn\nMessages to multiple destinations that are members of the Session.\nIt may be desirable to ensure that all members of a multipoint\nSesion be reachable over the same kind of transport.  This is\nreferred to as a homogeneous multipoint Session.\n\n\nIt is also the case that as of this writing (release 14.12) there\nis a defect in the AllJoyn Routing Node code that causes problems\nwith heterogeneous multipoint sessions (mutipoint sessions with\nmembers reached through different Transports).  If the system\nhappens to preferentially select different advertisements on\ndifferent hosts, using TRANSPORT_ANY could cause connectivity\nproblems.\n\n\nBecause of these situations, one should specify a single transport\ntype for multipoint sessions.\n\n\nRecommendation 3\n\n\n\n\nConsider making a single explicit choice of transport when\nusing multipoint sessions to avoid different qualities of service\namong session members and to work around a code defect in release\n14.12 of the Routing Node.\n\n\n\n\nAllJoyn TCP Transport\n\n\nThe AllJoyn system  provides a Transport based on the TCP/IP protocol.\nTCP/IP is the workhorse of the current Internet, has a long history,\nand works well over a very large range of links of it rates\nand signal qualities.\n\n\nTCP, defined by RFC-793, has been used extensively in many\ndisparate environments. From this, one can infer that since\nTCP/IP is almost always a good choice for communicating over\nthe greater Internet, so the TCP Transport is almost always\na good choice for AllJoyn Transport mechanism.\n\n\nIt is worthwhile to understand, however, that while there\nare a number of things that TCP is very good at, there are\nalso some things that TCP does not do well.\n\n\nAdvantages to using TCP\n\n\nTCP/IP provides a connection-oriented, error-checked, ordered,\nreliably delivered stream of bytes between communication endpoints.\nThis kind of stream is often called a flow, and corresponds\nto the transmission mechanism underlying the concept of a\nSession in the AllJoyn system.\n\n\nThe AllJoyn system converts Messages (Method Calls, Replies, Signals, etc.)\ninto a collection of bytes and passes them to TCP. In turn,\nTCP takes the bytes that make up sequences of Messages and\nbreaks them up into whatever TCP considers to be the best-sided\n\"chunks\" of data to send. TCP calls these chunks \"segments\"\nand it is these segments that are sent to the IP layer.\nNote that there is no necessary correlation between the\ndelimitation of TCP segments and AllJoyn Messages. These chunks\nare delivered to the remote side of a connection, reorganized\ninto a stream of bytes and delivered to the AllJoyn system.\nIt is the stream of bytes that is delivered between AllJoyn\ninstances and there are no record markers inserted automatically\nby TCP - TCP provides a byte stream service.\n\n\nThe upshot of this is that TCP is very good at moving streams\nof bytes from one place to another over internetworks of\npossibly dramatically differing and somewhat typically\nasymmetric link speeds. TCP is typically configured by default\nwith quite large buffers allowing for high bandwidth-delay\nproducts over the current Internet; but also provides flow\ncontrol to prevent a fast writer from overrunning a slow reader.\nBasically, TCP is designed to be very good at transferring\nlarge amounts of data; and it accomplishes this goal very well.\nIf the traffic pattern presented by a distributed application\npresents as a sequence of very large AllJoyn Messages it\nappears to the underlying system as a byte stream to be transferred.\n\n\nRecommendation 4\n\n\n\n\nIf the primary concern of a distributed application is the\nability to transfer large amounts of data reliably, prefer the\nAllJoyn TCP Transport, and selectively join Sessions only to\nBus Attachments advertising over TRANSPORT_TCP.\n\n\n\n\nDisadvantages to using TCP (reasons to use UDP)\n\n\nIn order to accommodate the wildly varying qualities of service\nof the worldwide Internet, TCP is also quite aggressive about\ntrying to get data sent from one end to another. This means\nthat it will retry transmissions for quite a long time before\ngiving up. This can translate into a significant delay (13 minutes,\nin many cases) before a Bus Attachment is notified of a link failure.\nLink failure can happen frequently in mobile environments as\ndevices move from one access point to another, for example.\n\n\nTCP does provide a keep-alive mechanism designed to mitigate\nthis problem, but support is platform-specific and spotty.\nThe AllJoyn system provides a layer 5 mechanism called LinikTimeout to\nimplement a device independent link failure detection mechanism.\n\n\nRecommendation 5\n\n\n\n\nIf using the TCP Transport, consider using the LinkTimeout\nfeature to quickly detect link failures; or consider the UDP Transport.\n\n\n\n\nThe counterpoint to the observation about TCP trying very hard\nto get data from one side of a connection to another is\nexactly that. TCP tries many times over a long period of time\nto get data to the remote host  . Thus, if the application\nrequires such intensive retry and can tolerate long delays\nbefore links are declared down, TCP will be much more aggressive\nin trying to get data across a link.\n\n\nRecommendation 6\n\n\n\n\nIf the primary concern of a distributed application is the\nability to move data reliably, prefer the AllJoyn TCP Transport\nand do not set a LinkTimeout.\n\n\n\n\nTo avoid congestion collapse of the greater internetwork,\nTCP implements significant congestion control mechanisms\nare used in TCP. These include slow-start, which begins transfers\nslowly in order to avoid filling the internet \"pipe\" with data\nwhich might be dropped due to congestion. Because slow-start\nwill delay use of full-bandwidth capabilities of the network,\nintermittent or infrequent traffic patterns in which a device\nis idle for a time, then sends a burst of data, and then goes\nidle again may run afoul of slow-start. Since the AllJoyn\nUDP Transport is designed to run only on local subnetworks,\nit does not implement slow-start.\n\n\nRecommendation 7\n\n\n\n\nIf the traffic pattern of the distributed application\nconsists of bursts of significant amounts of data between\nfairly extended periods of idling, consider using the UDP Transport\nto avoid effects of TCP slow-start.\n\n\n\n\nThere have been several additions to TCP to accommodate call-and-response\ntraffic patterns, such as delayed ACK and the Nagle algorithm.\nNonetheless, TCP is oriented toward transferring large amounts\nof data. TCP is not very good at sending a small amount of data\nand receiving a small amount of data in return - exactly the\nkind of interactions typical of Remote Procedure Call; and the\nAllJoyn system is, at its heart, an RPC system.\n\n\nRecommendation 8\n\n\n\n\nIf the traffic pattern of the distributed application\nconsists of Remote Procedure Calls, especially with call and\nreply Messages of length less than 1480 bytes, consider using\nthe UDP Transport which is optimized for this kind of interaction.\n\n\n\n\nSince TCP is a reliable byte stream protocol, its whole reason\nfor being is to transfer all bytes from one end to another.\nThis is not always desirable. In a real-time system, it is\noften the case that out-of-date data is worthless. Such\nout-of-date data simply consumes network and host resources\nunnecessarily. Since TCP simply transfers streams of bytes\nreliably, there is no opportunity to drop worthless data once\nit has been delivered to the system. The UDP Transport has\nbeen optimized to allow AllJoyn Messages to be timestamped\nand will drop the UDP datagrams that make up an AllJoyn Message\nat any time the datagrams are found to be out of date.\n\n\nRecommendation 9\n\n\n\n\nIf the traffic pattern of the distributed application includes messages\nwith a finite Time to Live (TTL), consider using the UDP Transport\nwhich provides significantly improved support for avoiding unnecessary\ntransmission of Messages with expired TTL.\n\n\n\n\nTCP provides a three-way handshake consisting of SYN, SYN+ACK,\nand ACK segments. This TCP-specific messaging must complete\nbefore any user data may be transferred. Since the AllJoyn system\nis derived from D-Bus, and D-Bus requires a SASL authentication phase,\nThe AllJoyn system must implement a SASL exchange for D-Bus compatibility on\nTCP. The AllJoyn system also requires its own handshake consisting of the\nexchange of a BusHello Message and a HelloReply Reply message.\nThus, connection establishment using TCP requires the following:\n\n At least three packets be exchanged for TCP connection establishment\n\n Four packets for the SASL exchange and ACKs\n* Four packets for BusHello, reply and ACK.\n\n\nAdditionally, TCP requires a four-way handshake for connection termination.\n\n\nThe UDP Transport uses much simplified signaling and, since\nit is an AllJoyn-specific protocol, piggybacks AllJoyn session\nestablishment messages on top of the ARDP SYN and SYN+ACK exchanges.\nConnection termination is handled in the UDP Transport at the\nsession layer, so only one or two packets are required for\nconnection termination - four or five packets of overhead,\nas compared to eleven. At a round-trip delay of six milliseconds,\nthis can be a significant improvement.\n\n\nRecommendation 10\n\n\n\n\nIf the traffic pattern of the distributed application includes\nfrequent connection establishment and termination, consider\nusing the UDP Transport which requires significantly fewer\npackets to establish and terminate connections.\n\n\n\n\nAllJoyn UDP Transport\n\n\nOverview\n\n\nThe AllJoyn system provides a Transport based on the UDP/IP protocol.\nUDP is a very simple, datagram-oriented (packet-based) layer 4 protocol.\nEach output operation by an application will produce one\ndatagram which, modulo fragmentation, is sent to the remote\ndestination   which receives it as one input operation.\n\n\nUnlike TCP, UDP provides no guarantees of ordering or delivery.\nSince AllJoyn Message streams do provide such guarantees,\na reliability layer must be provided to use UDP in the AllJoyn system.\nThe reliability and ordering guarantees are provided by the\nAllJoyn Reliable Datagram Protocol (ARDP). Additionally,\nARDP provides the fragmentation mechanism required to send\nmaximal AllJoyn Messages (about 130 Kbytes) over UDP\nwhich has a maximum datagram size of 64 Kbytes.\n\n\nNOTE:\n For more information about UDP, review RFC 768: User\nDatagram Protocol and RFC 908: Reliable Data Protocol.\n\n\nAdvantages to using UDP\n\n\nThe goal of the UDP Transport is to address the areas of\nweakness that the TCP Transport presents when executing call\nand response traffic patterns. The UDP Transport does not do\nany kind of congestion control since it is expected to operate\nonly on directly connected subnetworks. It therefore does not\ndo slow-start and lost packets are not considered an indication\nof congestion, which is not necessarily an appropriate inference\nin wireless networks.\n\n\nRecommendation 11\n\n\n\n\nIf the environment in which applications are expected to be\ndeployed corresponds to communication over wireless physical\nlayers and communication is expected to be only on the directly\nconnected subnetwork, consider the UDP Transport.\n\n\n\n\nSince the UDP Transport is a packet-oriented transport, it is\npossible to map AllJoyn Messages directly into packets.\nThis allows for selectively dropping the constituent packets\nof a packet stream according to expired TTL. Since this selective\ndropping of AllJoyn Messages cannot be done in TCP, when the\noffered load of a network   exceeds its capabilities, the TCP Transport\ntends to \"back up\" with the in-flight segments, all consisting\nof data which will be ultimately dropped. In extreme cases,\nthe network can be completely congested with data that will\nbe discarded, the end result being no interesting (on-time)\ndata is transferred.\n\n\nRecommendation 12\n\n\n\n\nIf applications use the Time to Live (TTL) option in Messages,\nconsider the UDP Transport which provides a much improved ability\nto drop non-interesting (not on-time) data.\n\n\n\n\nSince UDP Datagrams are not associated with specific sockets in\nthe BSD Sockets API, it is possible for a single socket to\nsupport multiple ARDP connections. This corresponds to the\nability of multiple AllJoyn Sessions to run over a single socket.\nIt also turns out that File Descriptors must be allocated in\nan AllJoyn Routing Node to handle events related to a Session\nand communication endpoint management. Since both sockets,\nand more generally file descriptors, are operating system\nresources which may be limited, specifying the UDP Transport\ncan allow many more connections on a given host system.\n\n\nRecommendation 13\n\n\n\n\nIf socket or file descriptor resource usage is anticipated\nto be a problem, consider specifying the UDP Transport which\nuses fewer resources per connection than the TCP Transport.\n\n\n\n\nTuning the TCP Transport\n\n\nEach system that provides a networking subsystem and TCP/IP\nprotocol suite usually presents a number of tunable parameters\nfor those subsystems. In Linux systems, these parameters are\ntypically accessed through the sysctl interface; in Windows,\nthere will be a number of corresponding Registry entries.\nOperating system providers will initialize these various\nparameters with values that provide good tradeoffs for the\nsystems and environments involved.\n\n\nThere is a wealth of information regarding tuning these network\nand TCP parameters available on the Internet. We therefore will\nnot duplicate that information here. When tuning for the AllJoyn system,\nremember that sequences of AllJoyn Messages are converted into\nbyte streams and ultimately sent to TCP/IP by the AllJoyn TCP Transport.\nIt is the linearized AllJoyn message stream that is the traffic\npattern to be optimized for.\n\n\nIt is a testament to TCP and the selection of these various\ntuning parameters that the vast majority of system users will\nnot attempt to change the underlying TCP configuration. In most\ncases, the system is left as-shipped and it will work sufficiently well.\n\n\nWireshark can provide valuable insights into the TCP messaging\nthat occurs in AllJoyn systems. The AllJoyn system has provided\na dissector to the Wireshark project which is now included in\nthe standard Wireshark distributions.\n\n\nTuning the UDP Transport\n\n\nEach system that provides a networking subsystem and TCP/IP\nprotocol suite usually presents a number of tunable parameters.\nIn Linux systems, these parameters are typically accessed\nthrough the \nsysctl\n interface; and in Windows there will be a\nnumber of corresponding Registry entries. Operating System\nproviders will initialize these various parameters with values\nthat provide good tradeoffs for the systems and environments involved.\n\n\nThere is a wealth of information regarding tuning these network\nand UDP parameters available on the Internet. We therefore\nwill not duplicate that information here. When tuning for\nthe AllJoyn system, remember that sequences of AllJoyn Messages\nare converted into UDP Datagrams by the AllJoyn UDP Transport.\nIt is the sequence of AllJoyn messages sent as datagrams that\nforms the traffic pattern to be optimized for.\n\n\nSocket buffers\n\n\nSince the vast majority of Internet traffic is sent over TCP,\ntuning the UDP protocol has become somewhat of a second-order\nproblem. The socket buffers provided by default for UDP are\noften quite small, on the order of 128 Kbytes. While this is\nsufficient for many uses of UDP such as name services, it is\nsmall when compared to the bandwidth-delay product of modern\nWi-Fi systems.\n\n\nNOTE:\n An 802.11n system using Modulation and Coding Scheme (MCS) 11\ncan run at 300 megabits per second. Given a round-trip time of\n6 msec, this corresponds to a buffer size of 225 Kbytes.\n\n\nOne thing to keep in mind when considering buffer sizes for\nthe UDP Transport is that one socket may be shared by a number\nof Sessions. The UDP Transport actually provides additional\nbuffering on a per-connection basis in order to accommodate\nat least one maximally sized AllJoyn Message (about 130 Kbytes)\n\n\nWireshark can provide valuable insights into the UDP messaging\nthat occurs in AllJoyn systems. The AllJoyn system has provided\na dissector to the Wireshark project which is now included in\nthe standard Wireshark distributions.\n\n\nARDP configuration\n\n\nAlong with the UDP subsystem, the UDP Transport provides the\nARDP reliability layer (detailed in \nOverview\n.\nThere are a number of configurable parameters corresponding\nto ARDP, but two of those configuration items are of utmost\nimportance: SEGBMAX and SEGMAX.\n\n The SEGBMAX parameter sets the limit on how large of a\nUDP Datagram that ARDP will use when fragmenting AllJoyn Messages.\n\n The SEGMAX parameter sets the number of datagrams that can be\nin-transit at any time.\n\n\nSEGBMAX can be thought of as corresponding loosely to the\nMaximum Segment Size (MSS) of TCP and SEGMAX can be thought of\nas corresponding to the receive window size.\n\n\nTypically, the primary use case of the UDP Transport will be\nto transfer relatively small RPC Messages and the corresponding\nMessage Reply. The SEGMAX and SEGBMAX parameters are irrelevant\nif transferring messages and replies of less than 1480 bytes\nsince all data fits into one packet. However when transferring\nlarger amounts of data, it is possible to optimize ARDP in\nways that can make it significantly faster than TCP.\n\n\nTuning scenario\n\n\nWhile the level of tuning described below will be rarely needed,\nthe scenario is provided for completeness and as an illustration\nof how the UDP Transport works.\n\n\nNOTE:\n This analysis was done using the default network and\nUDP protocol settings of the Linux system on which the experiments were run.\n\n\nSEGBMAX setting\n\n\nThe following figure shows a sensitivity analysis for the\nsetting of SEGBMAX. The time measured on the y-axis is the\ntime to transfer a 10 megabyte file in maximal (130 Kbytes)\nAllJoyn Messages.\n\n\n\n\nFigure:\n SEGBMAX sensitivity analysis\n\n\nSince UDP is a user-level protocol, all acknowledgments must\nbe done at user privilege  , which implies a context switch\nfor each packet. If SEGMAX is chosen to be too small, or if\nlarge amounts of data are sent in very small datagrams, much\ntime is spent simply context switching to ACK data - the system thrashes.\nAs SEGMAX approaches one packet (1480 byte payload) and moves\nupward toward the maximum UDP Datagram size, the system spends\nless and less time having to ACK individual smaller datagrams.\nThis tendency is counteracted, however, by the fact that as\nUDP datagram size increases, the number of actual PHY packets\nthat must be resent in the presence of a datagram loss also\nincreases. These pressures tend to cancel each other out in\npractice. In the data below, there is a local minimum at\nSEGBMAX of 4400 bytes which represents the optimal choice\nfor the 54 Mbit per second Wi-Fi.\n\n\nIn the test runs shown in the SEGBMAX sensitivity analysis,\nthe combination of SEGBMAX and SEGMAX was held constant at\nthe minimal value required to accommodate a maximal AllJoyn Message.\n\n\nSEGMAX setting\n\n\nThe following figure shows a sensitivity analysis for SEGMAX\nwith SEGBMAX held constant at 4440 bytes.\n\n\n\n\nFigure:\n SEGMAX sensitivity analysis\n\n\nThe plot starts with SEGMAX at 31 and plots the time to\ntransfer a 10 megabyte file for each SEGMAX value. It can\nbe seen that there is an underlying step function that\njumps at SEGMAX values of 31, 62, and 93. These correspond\nto the values at which one, two and three maximal AllJoyn Messages\ncan be buffered in the system. There is a significant gain\nto double-buffering AllJoyn Messages at SEGMAX of 62 and\ngreater; and there is an incremental gain to triple-buffering\nAllJoyn Messages at SEGMAX of 93.\n\n\nNotice that the UDP Transport is slower than the TCP Transort\nwith single-buffering, slightly faster with double-buffering\nand significantly (15-20%) faster with triple buffering.\nSince there is no statistically significant improvement\npast triple-buffering, a good choice of SEGBMAX and SEGMAX\ncan be shown to be SEGBMAX = 4440 bytes, and SEGMAX = 93 datagrams.\nThis is in fact the choice made as the default for the ARDP configuration.\n\n\nIt is possible that different systems could have specific\ncharacteristics that change this analysis. For example, if the\nUDP Transport is run on a host device for which context switch\ntime is much higher and the network much cleaner, the tradeoff\nof context switch time versus network retransmission may be at\na different point. It is possible that different networking\nenvironments may require more datagram buffering to fill the\nin-transit data; or it may also be the case that triple-buffering\nis overkill on much slower networks.\n\n\nConclusion\n\n\nAs they are configured by default, both the UDP Transport\nand the TCP Transport provide a level of service as defined\nby the abstract notion of an AllJoyn Transport. Although\nthey both provide the same services, the characteristics of\nthe underlying transport mechanisms on which they are based percolate up.\n\n\nCharacteristics of underlying transports may be viewed as\neither advantages or disadvantages depending on the applications\nusing them and the requirements of those applications. Specific\ntraffic patterns generated by distributed applications may\nimply that the choice of one of the AllJoyn Transports can\nprovide significantly better levels of service than others.\n\n\nIt may also be the case that no specific choice of AllJoyn Transport\nis actually the best choice. In such situations, the fact that\na connection, any connection, is possible overrides the qualities\nof service possible from underlying transport mechanisms.\n\n\nIn any case, understanding the underlying traffic of a\ndistributed application and how AllJoyn Transports handle\nthat traffic allows for optimizing the distributed application behavior.",

            "text": "One of the fundamental abstractions in an AllJoyn system is that\nof a Transport. An AllJoyn Transport provides an abstract\nrepresentation of a collection of underlying mechanisms\nthat provides four basic functions  :   The ability to discover remote AllJoyn Bus Attachments or Interfaces  The ability to advertise local AllJoyn Bus Attachments to\nthe greater AllJoyn system  The ability to establish traffic flows to other AllJoyn devices  The ability to move AllJoyn Messages (representing Method Calls,\nMethod Replies or Signals) between devices.   In the ISO OSI seven-layer model, the transport layer is\nresponsible for moving data sequences from one host to another\nand maintaining appropriate transport-specific qualities of\nservice. One measure of quality of service, for example, is\nreliable and ordered delivery of data. TCP and UDP both move\ndata sequences from one host to another, and have different\nquality of service guarantees. TCP provides reliable, ordered\nbyte streams; and UDP provides datagram services with no\nguarantee of ordering or reliable delivery. TCP and UDP are\nthus both transport layer (layer 4) protocols in the ISO OSI model.  AllJoyn Transports make use of lower-level OS services like TCP\nor UDP in order to manage the actual movement of data sequences,\nand therefore sit above layer 4 in the OSI protocol stack.\nSince the AllJoyn Transport manages underlying connections\non behalf of the application layer (layer 7) the concept of\nAllJoyn Transport most closely matches the session layer\n(layer 5) of the ISO OSI model.  AllJoyn Messaging  The AllJoyn Message layer, which is responsible for marshaling\nand unmarshaling of Signals and Method Calls, can be thought\nof as residing in the presentation layer (layer 6) of the ISO OSI model;\nand the routing functionality of the AllJoyn Routing Node\ncan be thought of as lying above AllJoyn Transports (still in layer 5),\nbut below the Message layer at layer 6.  In the following figure, notice that the AllJoyn Bus Attachment\ncorresponds to the application layer in the seven-layer model\nin that it provides the interface between the network stack\nand the application itself. Bus Attachments provide functionality\nrequired by the application to create, marshal and unmarshal\nAllJoyn Messages. This functionality corresponds to translating\nbetween application and network data formats and therefore\ncorresponds to the presentation layer in the seven-layer model.   Figure:  Mapping of AllJoyn system and OSI layer transports  AllJoyn Messages are sent to a local Routing Node which is\nresponsible for selecting an AllJoyn Transport over which\na given Message must be sent. AllJoyn Transports are responsible\nfor controlling the dialogs between computers and therefore\ncorrespond to the session layer of the seven-layer model.\nMessages are sent to an OSI transport layer mechanism,\nfor example TCP or UDP, with suitable guarantees of service.\nThe transport layer passes byte streams or datagrams to the\nnetwork layer   and then down to the 802.11 MAC and PHY\nin the figure.  Supported AllJoyn transports  Since an AllJoyn Transport encapsulates the functions of\nmoving data sequences, connections, and advertisement and\ndiscovery, there are separate AllJoyn Transports for separate\nunderlying mechanisms. For example, the AllJoyn TCP Transport\nuses TCP/IP as the mechanism for moving data between Routing Nodes;\nthe AllJoyn UDP Transport uses UDP/IP as the mechanism; the\nAllJoyn Bluetooth (BT) Transport does the same for Bluetooth\nconnections, and the AllJoyn Local Transport uses UNIX domain sockets.  Often, the name given to an AllJoyn Transport echoes the method\nused in the underlying OSI layer 4 mechanism. For example, the\nAllJoyn TCP transport uses TCP/IP to move bits from one host\nto another; the AllJoyn UDP Transport uses UDP/IP to actually move bits.  AllJoyn applications may select the AllJoyn Transport that is\nactually used by choosing one or more TransportMask bits in\nappropriate AllJoyn APIs. The currently defined TransportMask\nbits are listed in the following table.  AllJoyn TransportMask definition     Transport name  Value  Description      TRANSPORT_NONE  0x0000  No transport.    TRANSPORT_LOCAL  0x0001  The local transport.    TRANSPORT_BLUETOOTH  0x0002  Bluetooth transport.    TRANSPORT_WLAN  0x0004  Wireless local area network transport.    TRANSPORT_WWAN  0x0008  Wireless wide area network transport (not supported).    TRANSPORT_LAN  0x0010  Wired local area network transport.    TRANSPORT_ICE  0x0020  ICE (Interactive Connectivity Establishment) transport (not supported).    TRANSPORT_WFD  0x0080  Wi-Fi Direct transport (not supported).    TRANSPORT_ANY  0xFFFF   ~TRANSPORT_WFD  Any transport except Wi-Fi Direct.     Currently, the AllJoyn system's WLAN and LAN transports are\nsupported by a single underlying TCP transport.  Routing node transport  Each transport establishes and maintains connectivity based on\nthe underlying physical transport it supports. Based on the\ntype of underlying physical transport, the actual connectivity\nbetween two routing nodes in an AllJoyn network can be either\nsingle-hop or multi-hop. An AllJoyn distributed bus is an\noverlay network whose topology does not necessarily map directly\nto the topology of the underlying network. If an application\nhas no preference, it can provide TRANSPORT_ANY and allow the\nAllJoyn system to determine which transport to use.  The most commonly used Routing Node-to-Routing Node transports\nin the AllJoyn system are based on the IP family of transport\nmechanisms: TCP/IP and UDP/IP. These ISO layer 3 and 4 mechanisms\nare almost universally supported across the AllJoyn platforms\nof interest. Although from a high-level perspective, they\naccomplish the same objectives, at closer examination the\ngo about things slightly differently and therefore have different\nstrengths and weaknesses.  TCP  TCP and UDP are fairly complementary protocols, which is why\nthey are both present in the IP stack. TCP is a relatively\ncomplicated connection-based protocol that allows applications\nto send data reliably from one side to another. If data is\nlost, it is retransmitted automatically by TCP. The transmitted\ndata is stream-based which means that it is sent and received\nas a sequence of bytes that are arbitrarily (from the point\nof view of the sender) broken up into network packets.\nIn order to operate over the wider Internet, streams of TCP data\nare flow-controlled and TCP uses congestion-avoidance mechanisms\nto prevent congestion collapse in the presence of (many) multiple streams.  UDP  UDP, on the other hand, is a simple, high-speed \"wrapper\" around\nthe lower-level network layer (IP) functions provided to move data.\nUDP is inherently connectionless and data is sent in so-called\ndatagrams which are discrete \"packages\". UDP is not a connection-based\nprotocol; nor does it provide any reliability guarantees. There is\nno flow control nor is there congestion avoidance functionality present in UDP.  These low-level transport characteristics percolate up into the\ncorresponding AllJoyn Transports which take advantage of those\ncharacteristics to more efficiently accomplish the goals of applications.  Since underlying layer 4 mechanisms can provide very different\nqualities of service, one should infer that the choice of\nAllJoyn TransportMask, and therefore Transport, can have significant\neffects on the quality of service of an AllJoyn Message flow.\nMaking such choices effectively is the subject of the remainder\nof this document.  TransportMask  As shown in  AllJoyn TransportMask definition ,\na number of TransportMask-related symbols are defined as of\nthis writing. It is the case (for historical reasons) that although\nthey are associated with different bits, the symbols TRANSPORT_TCP,\nTRANSPORT_WLAN, TRANSPORT_WWAN, TRANSPORT_LAN all refer to the\nAllJoyn TCP Transport. It is recommended that only the symbols\nTRANSPORT_TCP be used to refer to the AllJoyn TCP Transport in\norder to minimize confusion. TRANSPORT_NONE is simply a constant\ndefined to be none of the transports, which isn't particularly useful.\nThe Wi-Fi Direct Transport (TRANSPORT_WFD) is not currently supported.\nThe implication is that only the following TransportMask definitions\nshould be used to refer to specific AllJoyn Transports:  TRANSPORT_TCP  TRANSPORT_UDP  Recommendation 1   Do not refer specifically to transports that are present for\nhistorical reasons such as TRANSPORT_WLAN, TRANSPORT_WWAN, or\nTRANSPORT_LAN; neither refer to currently unsupported transports\nsuch as TRNSPORT_WFD. Instead, prefer currently defined transports --\nTRANSPORT_TCP or TRANSPORT_UDP.   As mentioned above, symbols defining groups of transports are also provided:   TRANSPORT_IP - Describes both TRANSPORT_TCP and TRANSPORT_UDP  TRANSPORT_ANY - Refers to all currently defined transports\nthat are not considered experimental.  TRANSPORT_ALL - It is not recommended to use TRANSPORT_ALL\nunless there is a specific need to include all experimental\nAllJoyn Transports.   More typically, one would include specific experimental transports\non an as-needed basis.  If there is no need to select an AllJoyn Transport in order\nto take advantage of some specific quality of service, one\nwould pass TRANSPORT_ANY to all advertisement-, discovery-\nand session-related APIs. As a result, the AllJoyn Transport\nselected by an AllJoyn application is on a first-discovered\nbasis. That is, the first advertisement that happens to be\nreceived is the one that will drive the selection of transport.\nPresumably this is fine since by selecting TRANSPORT_ANY both\nthe advertising and discovering Bus Attachment are effectively\ndeclaring that \"anything I discover is fine\".  Recommendation 2   If the primary concern of a distributed application is the\nability to connect, that is, when neither the client nor the\nservice side of a communicating pair of Bus Attachments has\nany particular quality of service guarantee, prefer TRANSPORT_ANY\nand simply join a Session to the Bus Attachment corresponding\nto the first advertisement received.   Depending on the availability of AllJoyn Transport, this choice\nmay result in the selection of a very high-speed IP-based Transport\nsuch as TCP or UDP. It may also result in a communication link\nover a personal area network connection which may be relatively slow.\nSince the overriding goal is communication irrespective of\nmechanism, such choices are presumed to be appropriate.  In order to make any more meaningful choices, one must understand\nsome of the qualities of the existing AllJoyn Transports\nwhich might affect such a choice.  Homogeneous Multipoint Sessions  One of the connectivity options in the AllJoyn system is that of a\nmultipoint Session.  This option allows clients to send AllJoyn\nMessages to multiple destinations that are members of the Session.\nIt may be desirable to ensure that all members of a multipoint\nSesion be reachable over the same kind of transport.  This is\nreferred to as a homogeneous multipoint Session.  It is also the case that as of this writing (release 14.12) there\nis a defect in the AllJoyn Routing Node code that causes problems\nwith heterogeneous multipoint sessions (mutipoint sessions with\nmembers reached through different Transports).  If the system\nhappens to preferentially select different advertisements on\ndifferent hosts, using TRANSPORT_ANY could cause connectivity\nproblems.  Because of these situations, one should specify a single transport\ntype for multipoint sessions.  Recommendation 3   Consider making a single explicit choice of transport when\nusing multipoint sessions to avoid different qualities of service\namong session members and to work around a code defect in release\n14.12 of the Routing Node.",

            "text": "The AllJoyn system  provides a Transport based on the TCP/IP protocol.\nTCP/IP is the workhorse of the current Internet, has a long history,\nand works well over a very large range of links of it rates\nand signal qualities.  TCP, defined by RFC-793, has been used extensively in many\ndisparate environments. From this, one can infer that since\nTCP/IP is almost always a good choice for communicating over\nthe greater Internet, so the TCP Transport is almost always\na good choice for AllJoyn Transport mechanism.  It is worthwhile to understand, however, that while there\nare a number of things that TCP is very good at, there are\nalso some things that TCP does not do well.  Advantages to using TCP  TCP/IP provides a connection-oriented, error-checked, ordered,\nreliably delivered stream of bytes between communication endpoints.\nThis kind of stream is often called a flow, and corresponds\nto the transmission mechanism underlying the concept of a\nSession in the AllJoyn system.  The AllJoyn system converts Messages (Method Calls, Replies, Signals, etc.)\ninto a collection of bytes and passes them to TCP. In turn,\nTCP takes the bytes that make up sequences of Messages and\nbreaks them up into whatever TCP considers to be the best-sided\n\"chunks\" of data to send. TCP calls these chunks \"segments\"\nand it is these segments that are sent to the IP layer.\nNote that there is no necessary correlation between the\ndelimitation of TCP segments and AllJoyn Messages. These chunks\nare delivered to the remote side of a connection, reorganized\ninto a stream of bytes and delivered to the AllJoyn system.\nIt is the stream of bytes that is delivered between AllJoyn\ninstances and there are no record markers inserted automatically\nby TCP - TCP provides a byte stream service.  The upshot of this is that TCP is very good at moving streams\nof bytes from one place to another over internetworks of\npossibly dramatically differing and somewhat typically\nasymmetric link speeds. TCP is typically configured by default\nwith quite large buffers allowing for high bandwidth-delay\nproducts over the current Internet; but also provides flow\ncontrol to prevent a fast writer from overrunning a slow reader.\nBasically, TCP is designed to be very good at transferring\nlarge amounts of data; and it accomplishes this goal very well.\nIf the traffic pattern presented by a distributed application\npresents as a sequence of very large AllJoyn Messages it\nappears to the underlying system as a byte stream to be transferred.  Recommendation 4   If the primary concern of a distributed application is the\nability to transfer large amounts of data reliably, prefer the\nAllJoyn TCP Transport, and selectively join Sessions only to\nBus Attachments advertising over TRANSPORT_TCP.   Disadvantages to using TCP (reasons to use UDP)  In order to accommodate the wildly varying qualities of service\nof the worldwide Internet, TCP is also quite aggressive about\ntrying to get data sent from one end to another. This means\nthat it will retry transmissions for quite a long time before\ngiving up. This can translate into a significant delay (13 minutes,\nin many cases) before a Bus Attachment is notified of a link failure.\nLink failure can happen frequently in mobile environments as\ndevices move from one access point to another, for example.  TCP does provide a keep-alive mechanism designed to mitigate\nthis problem, but support is platform-specific and spotty.\nThe AllJoyn system provides a layer 5 mechanism called LinikTimeout to\nimplement a device independent link failure detection mechanism.  Recommendation 5   If using the TCP Transport, consider using the LinkTimeout\nfeature to quickly detect link failures; or consider the UDP Transport.   The counterpoint to the observation about TCP trying very hard\nto get data from one side of a connection to another is\nexactly that. TCP tries many times over a long period of time\nto get data to the remote host  . Thus, if the application\nrequires such intensive retry and can tolerate long delays\nbefore links are declared down, TCP will be much more aggressive\nin trying to get data across a link.  Recommendation 6   If the primary concern of a distributed application is the\nability to move data reliably, prefer the AllJoyn TCP Transport\nand do not set a LinkTimeout.   To avoid congestion collapse of the greater internetwork,\nTCP implements significant congestion control mechanisms\nare used in TCP. These include slow-start, which begins transfers\nslowly in order to avoid filling the internet \"pipe\" with data\nwhich might be dropped due to congestion. Because slow-start\nwill delay use of full-bandwidth capabilities of the network,\nintermittent or infrequent traffic patterns in which a device\nis idle for a time, then sends a burst of data, and then goes\nidle again may run afoul of slow-start. Since the AllJoyn\nUDP Transport is designed to run only on local subnetworks,\nit does not implement slow-start.  Recommendation 7   If the traffic pattern of the distributed application\nconsists of bursts of significant amounts of data between\nfairly extended periods of idling, consider using the UDP Transport\nto avoid effects of TCP slow-start.   There have been several additions to TCP to accommodate call-and-response\ntraffic patterns, such as delayed ACK and the Nagle algorithm.\nNonetheless, TCP is oriented toward transferring large amounts\nof data. TCP is not very good at sending a small amount of data\nand receiving a small amount of data in return - exactly the\nkind of interactions typical of Remote Procedure Call; and the\nAllJoyn system is, at its heart, an RPC system.  Recommendation 8   If the traffic pattern of the distributed application\nconsists of Remote Procedure Calls, especially with call and\nreply Messages of length less than 1480 bytes, consider using\nthe UDP Transport which is optimized for this kind of interaction.   Since TCP is a reliable byte stream protocol, its whole reason\nfor being is to transfer all bytes from one end to another.\nThis is not always desirable. In a real-time system, it is\noften the case that out-of-date data is worthless. Such\nout-of-date data simply consumes network and host resources\nunnecessarily. Since TCP simply transfers streams of bytes\nreliably, there is no opportunity to drop worthless data once\nit has been delivered to the system. The UDP Transport has\nbeen optimized to allow AllJoyn Messages to be timestamped\nand will drop the UDP datagrams that make up an AllJoyn Message\nat any time the datagrams are found to be out of date.  Recommendation 9   If the traffic pattern of the distributed application includes messages\nwith a finite Time to Live (TTL), consider using the UDP Transport\nwhich provides significantly improved support for avoiding unnecessary\ntransmission of Messages with expired TTL.   TCP provides a three-way handshake consisting of SYN, SYN+ACK,\nand ACK segments. This TCP-specific messaging must complete\nbefore any user data may be transferred. Since the AllJoyn system\nis derived from D-Bus, and D-Bus requires a SASL authentication phase,\nThe AllJoyn system must implement a SASL exchange for D-Bus compatibility on\nTCP. The AllJoyn system also requires its own handshake consisting of the\nexchange of a BusHello Message and a HelloReply Reply message.\nThus, connection establishment using TCP requires the following:  At least three packets be exchanged for TCP connection establishment  Four packets for the SASL exchange and ACKs\n* Four packets for BusHello, reply and ACK.  Additionally, TCP requires a four-way handshake for connection termination.  The UDP Transport uses much simplified signaling and, since\nit is an AllJoyn-specific protocol, piggybacks AllJoyn session\nestablishment messages on top of the ARDP SYN and SYN+ACK exchanges.\nConnection termination is handled in the UDP Transport at the\nsession layer, so only one or two packets are required for\nconnection termination - four or five packets of overhead,\nas compared to eleven. At a round-trip delay of six milliseconds,\nthis can be a significant improvement.  Recommendation 10   If the traffic pattern of the distributed application includes\nfrequent connection establishment and termination, consider\nusing the UDP Transport which requires significantly fewer\npackets to establish and terminate connections.",

            "text": "Overview  The AllJoyn system provides a Transport based on the UDP/IP protocol.\nUDP is a very simple, datagram-oriented (packet-based) layer 4 protocol.\nEach output operation by an application will produce one\ndatagram which, modulo fragmentation, is sent to the remote\ndestination   which receives it as one input operation.  Unlike TCP, UDP provides no guarantees of ordering or delivery.\nSince AllJoyn Message streams do provide such guarantees,\na reliability layer must be provided to use UDP in the AllJoyn system.\nThe reliability and ordering guarantees are provided by the\nAllJoyn Reliable Datagram Protocol (ARDP). Additionally,\nARDP provides the fragmentation mechanism required to send\nmaximal AllJoyn Messages (about 130 Kbytes) over UDP\nwhich has a maximum datagram size of 64 Kbytes.  NOTE:  For more information about UDP, review RFC 768: User\nDatagram Protocol and RFC 908: Reliable Data Protocol.  Advantages to using UDP  The goal of the UDP Transport is to address the areas of\nweakness that the TCP Transport presents when executing call\nand response traffic patterns. The UDP Transport does not do\nany kind of congestion control since it is expected to operate\nonly on directly connected subnetworks. It therefore does not\ndo slow-start and lost packets are not considered an indication\nof congestion, which is not necessarily an appropriate inference\nin wireless networks.  Recommendation 11   If the environment in which applications are expected to be\ndeployed corresponds to communication over wireless physical\nlayers and communication is expected to be only on the directly\nconnected subnetwork, consider the UDP Transport.   Since the UDP Transport is a packet-oriented transport, it is\npossible to map AllJoyn Messages directly into packets.\nThis allows for selectively dropping the constituent packets\nof a packet stream according to expired TTL. Since this selective\ndropping of AllJoyn Messages cannot be done in TCP, when the\noffered load of a network   exceeds its capabilities, the TCP Transport\ntends to \"back up\" with the in-flight segments, all consisting\nof data which will be ultimately dropped. In extreme cases,\nthe network can be completely congested with data that will\nbe discarded, the end result being no interesting (on-time)\ndata is transferred.  Recommendation 12   If applications use the Time to Live (TTL) option in Messages,\nconsider the UDP Transport which provides a much improved ability\nto drop non-interesting (not on-time) data.   Since UDP Datagrams are not associated with specific sockets in\nthe BSD Sockets API, it is possible for a single socket to\nsupport multiple ARDP connections. This corresponds to the\nability of multiple AllJoyn Sessions to run over a single socket.\nIt also turns out that File Descriptors must be allocated in\nan AllJoyn Routing Node to handle events related to a Session\nand communication endpoint management. Since both sockets,\nand more generally file descriptors, are operating system\nresources which may be limited, specifying the UDP Transport\ncan allow many more connections on a given host system.  Recommendation 13   If socket or file descriptor resource usage is anticipated\nto be a problem, consider specifying the UDP Transport which\nuses fewer resources per connection than the TCP Transport.",

When tuning for\nthe AllJoyn system, remember that sequences of AllJoyn Messages\nare converted into UDP Datagrams by the AllJoyn UDP Transport.\nIt is the sequence of AllJoyn messages sent as datagrams that\nforms the traffic pattern to be optimized for.  Socket buffers  Since the vast majority of Internet traffic is sent over TCP,\ntuning the UDP protocol has become somewhat of a second-order\nproblem. The socket buffers provided by default for UDP are\noften quite small, on the order of 128 Kbytes. While this is\nsufficient for many uses of UDP such as name services, it is\nsmall when compared to the bandwidth-delay product of modern\nWi-Fi systems.  NOTE:  An 802.11n system using Modulation and Coding Scheme (MCS) 11\ncan run at 300 megabits per second. Given a round-trip time of\n6 msec, this corresponds to a buffer size of 225 Kbytes.  One thing to keep in mind when considering buffer sizes for\nthe UDP Transport is that one socket may be shared by a number\nof Sessions. The UDP Transport actually provides additional\nbuffering on a per-connection basis in order to accommodate\nat least one maximally sized AllJoyn Message (about 130 Kbytes)  Wireshark can provide valuable insights into the UDP messaging\nthat occurs in AllJoyn systems. The AllJoyn system has provided\na dissector to the Wireshark project which is now included in\nthe standard Wireshark distributions.  ARDP configuration  Along with the UDP subsystem, the UDP Transport provides the\nARDP reliability layer (detailed in  Overview .\nThere are a number of configurable parameters corresponding\nto ARDP, but two of those configuration items are of utmost\nimportance: SEGBMAX and SEGMAX.  The SEGBMAX parameter sets the limit on how large of a\nUDP Datagram that ARDP will use when fragmenting AllJoyn Messages.  The SEGMAX parameter sets the number of datagrams that can be\nin-transit at any time.  SEGBMAX can be thought of as corresponding loosely to the\nMaximum Segment Size (MSS) of TCP and SEGMAX can be thought of\nas corresponding to the receive window size.  Typically, the primary use case of the UDP Transport will be\nto transfer relatively small RPC Messages and the corresponding\nMessage Reply. The SEGMAX and SEGBMAX parameters are irrelevant\nif transferring messages and replies of less than 1480 bytes\nsince all data fits into one packet. However when transferring\nlarger amounts of data, it is possible to optimize ARDP in\nways that can make it significantly faster than TCP.  Tuning scenario  While the level of tuning described below will be rarely needed,\nthe scenario is provided for completeness and as an illustration\nof how the UDP Transport works.  NOTE:  This analysis was done using the default network and\nUDP protocol settings of the Linux system on which the experiments were run.  SEGBMAX setting  The following figure shows a sensitivity analysis for the\nsetting of SEGBMAX. The time measured on the y-axis is the\ntime to transfer a 10 megabyte file in maximal (130 Kbytes)\nAllJoyn Messages.   Figure:  SEGBMAX sensitivity analysis  Since UDP is a user-level protocol, all acknowledgments must\nbe done at user privilege  , which implies a context switch\nfor each packet. If SEGMAX is chosen to be too small, or if\nlarge amounts of data are sent in very small datagrams, much\ntime is spent simply context switching to ACK data - the system thrashes.\nAs SEGMAX approaches one packet (1480 byte payload) and moves\nupward toward the maximum UDP Datagram size, the system spends\nless and less time having to ACK individual smaller datagrams.\nThis tendency is counteracted, however, by the fact that as\nUDP datagram size increases, the number of actual PHY packets\nthat must be resent in the presence of a datagram loss also\nincreases. These pressures tend to cancel each other out in\npractice. In the data below, there is a local minimum at\nSEGBMAX of 4400 bytes which represents the optimal choice\nfor the 54 Mbit per second Wi-Fi.  In the test runs shown in the SEGBMAX sensitivity analysis,\nthe combination of SEGBMAX and SEGMAX was held constant at\nthe minimal value required to accommodate a maximal AllJoyn Message.  SEGMAX setting  The following figure shows a sensitivity analysis for SEGMAX\nwith SEGBMAX held constant at 4440 bytes.   Figure:  SEGMAX sensitivity analysis  The plot starts with SEGMAX at 31 and plots the time to\ntransfer a 10 megabyte file for each SEGMAX value. It can\nbe seen that there is an underlying step function that\njumps at SEGMAX values of 31, 62, and 93. These correspond\nto the values at which one, two and three maximal AllJoyn Messages\ncan be buffered in the system. There is a significant gain\nto double-buffering AllJoyn Messages at SEGMAX of 62 and\ngreater; and there is an incremental gain to triple-buffering\nAllJoyn Messages at SEGMAX of 93.  Notice that the UDP Transport is slower than the TCP Transort\nwith single-buffering, slightly faster with double-buffering\nand significantly (15-20%) faster with triple buffering.\nSince there is no statistically significant improvement\npast triple-buffering, a good choice of SEGBMAX and SEGMAX\ncan be shown to be SEGBMAX = 4440 bytes, and SEGMAX = 93 datagrams.\nThis is in fact the choice made as the default for the ARDP configuration.  It is possible that different systems could have specific\ncharacteristics that change this analysis. For example, if the\nUDP Transport is run on a host device for which context switch\ntime is much higher and the network much cleaner, the tradeoff\nof context switch time versus network retransmission may be at\na different point. It is possible that different networking\nenvironments may require more datagram buffering to fill the\nin-transit data; or it may also be the case that triple-buffering\nis overkill on much slower networks.",

(Open a browser\nand navigate to http://developer.android.com for instructions on how to do this.)\n\n\n\n\nGo to your workspace and find the folder that contains\nthe new Android project.\n\n\n\n\nThe project folder should contain the following (it may contain more):\n\n\n\n\nres folder\n\n\nsrc folder\n\n\n\n\nAndroidManifest.xml file\n\n\n\n\n\n\nCreate a new folder with the name \nlibs\n.\n\n\n\n\nCopy the file \n/java/jar/alljoyn.jar\n\n   to the new libs folder.\n\n\nIn the libs folder, create another folder with the name \narmeabi\n.\n\n\nCopy the \nliballjoyn_java.so\n file from the AllJoyn\n   distribution to the \narmeabi\n folder.\n   The file is in the AllJoyn distribution in the folder\n   \n/java/libs/liballjoyn_java.so.\n\n\n\n\nYou should now have a project directory structure that is\n   similar to this (only a partial view of a project).\n\n\n+\nproject name\n\n   |\\src\n   ||-\nsource code files\n\n   |\\libs\n   ||\\armeabi\n   |||-liballjoyn_java.so\n   ||-alljoyn.jar\n   |\\res\n   ||-\nproject resources\n\n   |-AndroidManifest.xml\n\n\nNOTE:\n It may be simpler to copy an already existing libs folder\nfrom one of the samples found in \n/java/samples.\n\n\n\n\nIn Eclipse, right-click on your project and select the \nProperties\n option.\n\n\nSelect the \nJava Build Path\n.\n\n\nClick \nAdd JARs\n.\n\n\nSelect the \nalljoyn.jar\n file from the \n/libs\n folder.\n\n\n\n\nIMPORTANT: Make sure the files are from the Android distribution\nof the AllJoyn framework and not the Linux distribution.\nThe files will have identical names, but the Linux distribution\nis not compiled for the Arm processor used on most Android phones;\nit is designed for the PC x86 architecture.\n\n\nStarting a New Project for Desktop Development\n\n\n\n\nCreate a new Java Project.\n\n\nIn the step where you define the Java build settings, select the \nLibraries\n tab.\n\n\nClick \nAdd External JARs...\n\n\nSelect \nalljoyn.jar\n from the \n/java/jar directory.\n\n\nClick the arrow next to the alljoyn.jar listed in your JARs,\nwhich brings up a list of Source attachment, Javadoc location,\nNative library location, and Access rules for alljoyn.jar.\n\n\nDouble-click \nNative library location\n, which brings up a dialog.\n\n\nClick the \nExternal Folder...\n button.\n\n\nSelect the directory that contains liballjoyn_java.so \n/java/lib.\n\n\nDouble-click \nJavadoc location\n.\n\n\nClick \nBrowse...\n.\n\n\nSelect the directory that contains the java docs for\nalljoyn.jar \n/java/docs.\n\n\nClick \nFinish\n.\n\n\n\n\nNOTE:\n To add the AllJoyn framework to an already existing project,\ngo to the project properties, select the 'Java Build Path' properties,\nand follow the steps listed above.\n\n\nWriting Code\n\n\nAll code snippets found in this document were taken from samples\nthat can be found in the Windows SDK in the java/samples folder,\nor on \nGerrit\n.\n\n\nIf you are programming for Android, the code snippets are still\nuseful for understanding the AllJoyn framework. The Android SDK\nhas its own collection of samples. For more information see\n\nAndroid-Specific Considerations\n, or check out the samples found\nin the AllJoyn Android SDK.\n\n\nLoading the native library\n\n\nYou must load the native system library into your code at runtime.\nTo do so, add the following lines to your code.\n\n\nCode 1. Load native library\n\n\nstatic {\n   System.loadLibrary(\nalljoyn_java\n);\n}\n\n\n\n\nCreating an AllJoyn interface\n\n\nThe AllJoyn framework enables inter-process communication\nthrough an object. The object is defined as a bus interface.\n\n\nEach interface can contain:\n\n\n\n\nMethods\n\n\nSignals\n\n\nProperties\n\n\n\n\nCode 2. Example of an interface\n\n\n@BusInterface (name = \norg.my.interface.name\n)\npublic interface MyInterface {\n\n   @BusMethod\n   public String MyMethod(String inStr) throws BusException;\n\n   @BusSignal\n   public void MySignal(String inStr) throws BusException;\n\n   @BusProperty\n   public String GetMyProperty() throws BusException;\n\n   @BusProperty\n   public void SetMyProperty(String myProperty) throws  BusException;\n\n}\n\n\n\n\nUsing @BusInterface annotation\n\n\nThe @BusInterface annotation tells the code that this\ninterface is an AllJoyn interface. All bus interfaces\nmust have a name. If you do not assign a name, a default\nname is assigned.\n\n\nThe default interface name is \n.\n.\n\n\nGenerally, you should choose your interface name and not use\nthe default. Set the interface name by specifying the name\nannotation property.\n\n\nInterface naming rules\n from http://dbus.freedesktop.org/doc/dbus-specification.html.\n\n\n\n\nInterfaces have names with type STRING, meaning that they\nmust be valid UTF-8 characters.\n\n\nThere are also some additional restrictions that apply\nto interface names, specifically:\n\n\nInterface names are composed of one or more elements\n  separated by a period (\".\") character. All elements must\n  contain at least one character.\n\n\nEach element must only contain the ASCII characters\n  [A-Z][a-z][0-9]_ and must not begin with a digit.\n\n\nInterface names must contain at least one \".\" (period)\n  character (and thus at least two elements).\n\n\nInterface names must not begin with a \".\" (period) character.\n\n\nInterface names must not exceed the maximum name length of 255 characters.\n\n\n\n\nUsing @BusMethod annotation\n\n\nThe @BusMethod annotation tells the Java compiler that\nthis is a bus method. AllJoyn methods work almost identical\nto a regular method in Java. The major difference is that\nthe AllJoyn methods execute on a different process or device.\nThe method can accept multiple arguments and reply with\nmultiple arguments. AllJoyn methods can have multiple\nreturn values, but Java methods only allow a single return\nvalue. To receive multiple return values requires a container\nthat can hold the multiple return values.\n\nMultiple return values\n explains how to do this.\n\n\nThe @BusMethod annotation has four properties: annotation, name,\nsignature, and replySignature.\n\n\nUnder normal circumstances, the values for the annotation\nproperties can be determined by the AllJoyn framework.\nHowever, there are instances in which the signature must\nbe specified; for example you need to send an unsigned integer\nin a method. Since Java does not have an unsigned integer type,\nthis must be specified in the @BusMethod annotation.\n\n\nCode 3. Specifying signature and replySignature\n\n\n@BusMethod(signature=\nu\n, replySignature=\nu\n)\npublic int MyMethod3(int unsignedArg) throws BusException;\n\n\n\n\nThe AllJoyn framework is very good at automatically assigning\na signature for the arguments specified in the method or signal.\nIf given the code shown in \nCode 4. Auto assignment of signatures\n, note that the\nsignature and replySignature are not specified as part of\nthe @BusMethod annotation. The AllJoyn framework automatically\nassigns this method a signature \"sdib\" and a replySignature of\n\"i.\" The only time you must specify the signature is when it\ncannot be obtained from the interface itself.\n\n\nCode 4. Auto assignment of signatures\n\n\n@BusMethod\npublic int MyMethod4(String sArg,\n   double dArg,\n   int iArg,\n   boolean bArg) throws BusException;\n\n\n\n\nThe valid values for the signature and replySignature are any\nvalues that are valid according to http://dbus.freedesktop.org/doc/dbus-specification.html.\n\n\nUsing @BusSignal annotation\n\n\nThe @BusSignal annotation specifies that the following code\nis an AllJoyn signal. Unlike methods, signals have no replies.\nBecause of this, signals always have a return type of void.\n\n\nLike methods, signals can take multiple arguments.\n\n\nA signal is seen only if a program has registered a signal\nhandler for that signal. See \nUsing AllJoyn signals\n\nto register and use a signal handler.\n\n\nUsing @BusProperty annotation\n\n\nThe @BusProperty annotation specifies that the following code\nis an AllJoyn property. AllJoyn properties are exactly like\nAllJoyn methods except they are specialized for get/set\ncommands of a single value.\n\n\nMore complex AllJoyn interface concepts\n\n\nMaking a secure bus interface using the @Secure annotation\n\n\nIndicating that an interface must use a secured authentication\nmechanism is as simple as adding the @Secure annotation to the interface.\n\n\nCode 5. Creating a secure interface\n\n\n@BusInterface(name = \norg.sample.SecureInterface\n)\n@Secure\npublic interface SecureInterface {\n\n   @BusMethod\n   String myMethod(String inStr) throws BusException;\n}\n\n\n\n\nThe @Secure annotation informs the bus that no method call\nor signal can be sent without authentication.\n\n\nThe server must authenticate that the client is trusted\nusing one of the built-in authentication protocols.\nAfter authentication is completed, all messages and signals\nhave the body of the message encrypted. Only the authenticated\nclient can read the message. Only the body of the message is encrypted.\nThe header is left unencrypted and any bus can read the header\nand use it to forward the message to its destination.\n\n\nThe @Secure annotation has the property \nvalue\n [AllJoyn 3.4.0].\nThe 'value' property can have one of the following values:\n\n\n\n\nrequired (default value) - Methods on the interface can\nonly be called by an authenticated peer.\n\n\noff - Authentication is never required.\n\n\ninherit - The object inherits the security of the objects\nthat implement the interface.\n\n\nIf an unknown value is specified the interface will default\nto inherit.\n\n\n\n\nNormally, \nvalue\n will not need to be explicitly specified\nunless you want the value 'off' since using @Secure without\nspecifying a value is the same as specifying \n@secure(value=\"required\")\n.\nInterfaces that omit the @Secure annotation is the same as\nspecifying \n@Secure(value=\"inherit\")\n.\n\n\nIn general, unless you are sure your interface will never\nneed authentication, it is best to avoid using `@Secure(value=\"off\")\nin your interface specification.\n\n\nFor more information on the three built-in authentication\nmechanisms, see \nAllJoyn authentication mechanisms\n.\n\n\nComplex data types using the @Position annotation\n\n\nBeyond simple data types, the AllJoyn framework can handle\ncomplex data types such as arrays, maps, and structs. In the case\nof arrays and maps, the data type can be handled by the AllJoyn code\nwith no special action. However, structs require additional annotation.\n\n\nThe AllJoyn framework must know the order of all elements of a\nstruct so that it can marshal and unmarshal (i.e., serialize)\nthe message. This is where the @Position annotation is used.\n\n\nSay that you have a structure that holds information about\na photo; the code could look something like this:\n\n\nCode 6. Example data structure using @Position annotation\n\n\npublic class ImageInfo{\n @Position(0)\n public String fileName;\n @Position(1)\n public int isoValue;\n @Position(2)\n public int dateTaken;\n}\n\n\n\n\nThe @Position annotation numbering must start from \"0\" (zero)\nand count up in increments of one. Skipping a number, like\ngoing from @Position(1) to @Position(3) without having an\n@Position(2) anywhere in the code, is a logic error.\n\n\nThe signature for all structures is \"r\" or the list of all\nthe values of the structure inside parentheses. For example,\nthe signature for the ImageInfo class would be \"(sii)\" in \nCode 6. Example data structure using @Position annotation\n.\n\n\nMultiple return values\n\n\nIf, for some reason, an interface with multiple return values\nis used, a container must be made to hold those values.\nIf you have a method called \"timer\" that returns a startTime\nand an endTime, an interface could be designed to handle\nthe two return values.\n\n\nCode 7. Method that accepts multiple return values\n\n\n@BusInterface (name = \norg.my.timerInterface\n)\npublic interface MultipleReturnValuesInterface {\n\n   public class Values {\n      @Position(0) public int startTime;\n      @Position(1) public int endTime;\n   }\n\n   @BusMethod(replySignature=\nii\n)\n\n   public Values timer() throws BusException;\n}\n\n\n\n\nNOTE:\n The replySignature has to be specified, or the AllJoyn framework\nassumes the replySignature is a struct with the replySignature \"(ii)\".\n\n\nParentheses indicate a struct, which is a single return value, while\nno parentheses indicate two separate return values.\n\n\nConnecting to the AllJoyn router\n\n\nWhen connecting with the bus, a program may act as a service,\na client, or both.\n\n\nConnecting a service\n\n\nConnecting a service consists of several steps.\n\n\n\n\nCreate a new BusAttachment.\n\n\nRegister a BusObject with a given absolute path using the BusAttachment.\n\n\nConnect the BusAttachment to the bus.\n\n\nRequest a well-known name from the bus.\n\n\n\n\nCode 8. Connecting a service to the bus (no error checking)\n\n\nmBus = new BusAttachment(\napplicationName\n);\nmBus.registerBusObject(this, \n/servicepath\n);\nmBus.connect();\nint flags = 0; //no request name flags\nmBus.requestName(\ncom.my.well.known.name\n, flags);\n\n\n\n\nThis code does not have any error handling; thus, it is a\npoor programming example. It does show what the functions are doing.\nThe functions BusAttachment.registerBusObject(...),\nBusAttachment.connect(), and DBusProxyObj.RequestName(...) all\nreturn status that should be checked.\n\n\nCode 9. Connecting a service (with error checking)\n\n\nmBus = new BusAttachment(\napplicationName\n);\nStatus status = mBus.registerBusObject(this, \n/servicepath\n);\nif (Status.OK != status) {\n   System.out.println(\nBusAttachment.registerBusObject() failed: \n + status);\n\n   System.exit(0);\n   return;\n}\n\nstatus = mBus.connect();\n\nif (Status.OK != status) {\n   System.out.println(\nBusAttachment.connect() failed: \n + status);\n   System.exit(0);\n   return;\n}\nint flags = 0; //no request name flags\nstatus = mBus.requestName(\ncom.my.well.known.name\n, flags);\nif (status != Status.OK) {\n   System.out.println(\nBusAttachment.requestName failed: \n + status);\n   System.exit(0);\n   return;\n}\n\n\n\n\nNOTE:\n This code would have to be in a class that implements the\nBusObject. If it did not implement the BusObject, the following\nline would not work:\n\n\nmBus.registerBusObject(this, \n/servicepath\n);\n\n\n\n\nThe flags value is a bit-mask that is used to tell the bus\nhow to respond if the well-known name requested already exists\non the bus. It also tells the bus how to act if the well-known name\nis already owned and another application requests the same well-known name.\n\n\nThe flag options are:\n\n\n\n\nBusAttachment.ALLJOYN_REQUEST_NAME_ALLOW_REPLACEMENT\n\n\nBusAttachment.ALLJOYN_REQUEST_NAME_REPLACE_EXISTING\n\n\nBusAttachment.ALLJOYN_REQUEST_NAME_DO_NOT_QUEUE\n\n\n\n\nAllJoyn request name flags\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAllJoyn flag name\n\n\nValue\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nALLJOYN_REQUEST_NAME_ALLOW_REPLACEMENT\n\n\n0x1\n\n\n\n\n\n\nALLJOYN_REQUEST_NAME_REPLACE_EXISTING\n\n\n0x2\n\n\n\n\n\n\nALLJOYN_REQUEST_NAME_DO_NOT_QUEUE\n\n\n0x4\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nUsing the value of 0x0 (zero) for the AllJoyn flag is a\nvalid option. It means do not use any requestName flags.\nWhen using no flags to request a well-known name from\nthe bus, if the name already exists on the bus, your\nname request is added to the queue of other applications\nthat have also requested that name.\n\n\nThe BusAttachment.requestName returns one of the following status values:\n\n\nResults from a RequestName call\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nDBusProxyObj.RequestName result\n\n\nValue\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nOK\n\n\n1\n\n\n\n\n\n\nDBUS_REQUEST_NAME_REPLY_IN_QUEUE\n\n\n2\n\n\n\n\n\n\nDBUS_REQUEST_NAME_REPLY_EXISTS\n\n\n3\n\n\n\n\n\n\nDBUS_REQUEST_NAME_REPLY_ALREADY_OWNER\n\n\n4\n\n\n\n\n\n\nBUS_UNEXPECTED_DISPOSITION\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nBUS_NOT_CONNECTED\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe valid flag combinations and RequestName results are\nall specified and described at http://dbus.freedesktop.org/doc/dbus-specification.html.\n\n\nConnecting a client\n\n\nTo connect a client:\n\n\n\n\nCreate a BusAttachment.\n\n\nConnect the BusAttachment to the bus.\n\n\nMake a proxy object with the service name, absolute service path,\nand the interface of interest.\n\n\nMake a proxy connection with the specified AllJoyn interface.\n\n\n(Optional) Register signal handlers if the interface of interest\nhas any signals or if you are interested in any of the signals\nthat are part of the D-Bus or AllJoyn specification.\n\n\n\n\nCode 10. Connecting a client (with error checking)\n\n\nmBus = new BusAttachment(\napplicationName\n);\n\nStatus status = mBus.connect();\nif (Status.OK != status) {\n   System.out.println(\nBusAttachment.connect() failed:\n + status));\n   System.exit(0);\n   return;\n}\n\nmProxyObj = mBus.getProxyBusObject(\norg.my.well.known.name\n,\n   \n/servicepath\n,\n   BusAttachment.SESSION_ID_ANY\n   new Class[] { MyInterface.class });\n\nmMyInterface = mProxyObj.getInterface(MyInterface.class);\n\nstatus = mBus.registerSignalHandlers(this);\nif (status != Status.OK) {\n   System.out.println(\nBusAttachment.registerSignalHandlers() failed:\n +\nstatus));\n   System.exit(0);\n   return;\n}\n\n\n\n\nmMyInterface can now be used to call methods found on the service.\n\n\nThe given well-known name and path can have multiple interfaces.\nWhen using \ngetProxyBusObject()\n, list all of the interfaces\nyou are interested in using. There could have been multiple\ninterfaces available at the object path \"/servicepath.\"\nIf there was a second interface called MySecondInterface and\nyou also wanted to make a proxy connection to that interface,\nthen you need to list both interfaces when calling \ngetProxyBusObject()\n.\n\n\nWhen calling the \ngetInterface()\n method, you are selecting\none of the possible interfaces out of the interfaces obtained\nfrom the \ngetProxyBusObject()\n method call.\n\n\nCode 11. Multiple interfaces\n\n\nmProxyObj = mBus.getProxyBusObject(\norg.my.well.known.name\n,\n   \n/servicepath\n,\n   BusAttachment.SESSION_ID_ANY,\n   new Class[] { MyInterface.class, MySecondInterface.class });\n\nmMyInterface = mProxyObj.getInterface(MyInterface.class);\nmMySecondInterface = mProxyObj.getInterface(MySecondInterface.class);\n\n\n\n\nDiscovery and sessions\n\n\nFull user control\n\n\nWhat makes the AllJoyn framework exciting is the ability to\ndiscover remote buses and interact with the interfaces on\nthose remote buses as if they are local.\n\n\nThe AllJoyn router runs in the background. If an application\nasks the router to look for a remote interface, the router\ntries to locate the requested service. When the router is started,\nit is told which transport protocols to use (i.e., Bluetooth, TCP/IP).\nIf any device can make a connection using any of the available\ntransport protocols, its services can then be discovered and\nused by all of the devices that have been discovered in a\ndynamically-formed, peer-to-peer network.\n\n\nOnce the well-known name has been discovered, your application\ncan join a started communication session using a user-selected session port.\n\n\nNOTE:\n Valid SessionPort values range from 1 to 0xFFFF.\n\n\nHow discovery works\n\n\nFor a service and client to discover each other, they must agree upon three things:\n\n\n\n\nA well-known bus name that will be advertised\n\n\nThe object path\n\n\nThe session port number that will be used\n\n\n\n\nThe discovery sequence follows.\n\n\n\n\nTo advertise a service, start with the procedure described in \nConnecting a service\n.\n\n\nCreate a new BusAttachment with RemoteMessage.Receive.\n\n\nRegister your BusObject; the local implementation of your\n     interface with the BusAttachment.\n\n\nRegister a BusListener; a bus listener may not be needed,\n     depending on your application.\n\n\nConnect the BusAttachment with the AllJoyn router.\n\n\n\n\nBind the session port.\n\n\nAs part of binding the session port, you also need to\n create a SessionPort Listener that is used to respond\n to JoinSession requests from the client.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nRequest a well-known name from the bus.\n\n\n\n\nAdvertise the same well-known name.\n\n\nTo connect to the advertised service:\n\n\nCreate a new BusAttachment with RemoteMessage.Receive.\n\n\nRegister a BusListener; in this case it is required\n     for the foundAdvertisedName signal.\n\n\nFind the Advertised well-known name.\n\n\nWhen the foundAdvertisedName signal is received, join the session.\n\n\n\n\nIMPORTANT: Although you can advertise different names than your\nservice's well-known name, it would result in the bus not being\nable to use your service. It is an error to advertise a different name\nthan your service's own well-known name.\n\n\nSample code\n\n\nCode 12. Obtaining a well-known name/advertising the well-known name\n\n\nBusAttachment mBus;\nmBus = new BusAttachment(getClass().getName(),\nBusAttachment.RemoteMessage.Receive);\n\nStatus status = mBus.registerBusObject(myBusObject, \n/MyService\n);\nif (status != Status.OK) {\n   System.exit(0);\n   return;\n}\n\nstatus = mBus.connect();\n\nif (status != Status.OK) {\n   System.exit(0);\n   return;\n}\n\nprivate static final short CONTACT_PORT=42;\nMutable.ShortValue contactPort = new Mutable.ShortValue(CONTACT_PORT);\nSessionOpts sessionOpts = new SessionOpts();\nsessionOpts.traffic = SessionOpts.TRAFFIC_MESSAGES;\nsessionOpts.isMultipoint = false; sessionOpts.proximity = SessionOpts.PROXIMITY_ANY;\nsessionOpts.transports = SessionOpts.TRANSPORT_ANY;\n\nstatus = mBus.bindSessionPort(contactPort, sessionOpts,\nnew SessionPortListener() {\n@Override\npublic boolean acceptSessionJoiner(short sessionPort,\nString joiner, SessionOpts sessionOpts) {\nif (sessionPort == CONTACT_PORT) {\nreturn true;\n} else {\nreturn false;\n}\n}\n});\n\nInt flags = 0; //do not use any request name flags\nstatus = mBus.requestName(\ncom.my.well.known.name\n, flags);\nif (status != Status.OK) {\n   System.exit(0);\n   return;\n}\n\n/*\n * Important: the well-known name advertised should be identical\n * to the well-known name requested from the bus.

This section shows how to write\nan AllJoyn bus method that can be instantiated from a remote process.\n\n\nSuppose you have the following interface:\n\n\nCode 14. Sample interface with AllJoyn methods\n\n\n@BusInterface (name = \norg.sample.busMethods\n)\npublic interface SampleInterface {\n\n   @BusMethod\n   public String Ping(String str) throws BusException;\n\n   @BusMethod\n   public String Concatenate(String arg1, String arg2) throws BusException;\n\n   @BusMethod\n   public int Fibonacci(int arg1) throws BusException;\n}\n\n\n\n\nCode 15. Implementing the SampleInterface in the Service\n\n\nclass SampleService implements SampleInterface, BusObject {\n   public String Ping(String str){\n      return str;\n   }\n\n   public String Concatenate(String arg1, String arg2){\n      return arg1+arg2;\n   }\n\n   public int Fibonacci(int arg1){\n      int a=0,b=1;\n\n   for (int i=0;i\narg1;i++){\n      a=a+b;\n      b=a-b;\n   }\n   return a;\n\n   }\n}\n\n\n\n\nNow that the SampleInterface has an implementation, you must\nuse a SampleService object when you are registering the bus object.\n\n\nCode 16.

Calling a remote method from the SampleInterface\n\n\nprivate BusAttachment mBus;\nmBus = new BusAttachment(getClass().getName(),\nBusAttachment.RemoteMessage.Receive);\n\nStatus status = mBus.connect();\nif (Status.OK != status) {\n   System.exit(0);\n   return;\n}\n\nprivate ProxyBusObject mProxyObj;\nprivate SampleInterface mSampleInterface;\n\nprivate static final short CONTACT_PORT=42;\n\nmBus.registerBusListener(new BusListener() {\n@Override\npublic void foundAdvertisedName(String name,\n   short transport,\n   String namePrefix) {\n      mBus.enableConcurrentCallbacks();\n      short contactPort = CONTACT_PORT;\n      SessionOpts sessionOpts = new SessionOpts();\n      sessionOpts.traffic = SessionOpts.TRAFFIC_MESSAGES;\n         sessionOpts.isMultipoint = false;\n         sessionOpts.proximity = SessionOpts.PROXIMITY_ANY;\n      sessionOpts.transports = SessionOpts.TRANSPORT_ANY;\n\n      Mutable.IntegerValue sessionId = new Mutable.IntegerValue();\n\n      Status status = mBus.joinSession(name,\ncontactPort,\nsessionId,\nsessionOpts,\nnew SessionListener());\n\n   mProxyObj = mBus.getProxyBusObject(\ncom.my.well.known.name\n,\n      \n/MyService\n,\n         sessionId.value,\n            new Class[] { SampleInterface.class });\n   mSampleInterface = mProxyObj.getInterface(SampleInterface.class);\n});\n\nStatus status = mBus.connect();\nif (status != Status.OK) {\n   System.exit(0);\n   return;\n}\n\nstatus = mBus.findAdvertisedName(\ncom.my.well.known.name\n);\nif (status != Status.OK) {\n   System.exit(0);\n   return;\n}\n\n\n\n\nNow that you have a proxy connection to the remote service\nthrough mSampleInterface, you can just call it like you would\nif the code were implemented locally.\n\n\nCode 18. Calling the remote methods\n\n\ntry {\n   // will return \nHello World\n\n   String strPing = mSampleInterface.Ping(\nHello World\n);\n   // will return \nThe Eagle has landed!\n\n   String strCat = mSampleInterface.Concatenate(\nThe Eagle \n, \nhas landed!\n);\n\n   // will return 3\n   int fib = mSampleInterface.Fibonacci(4);\n} catch (BusException e) {\n   //Handle exception here.\n}\n\n\n\n\nNot all methods need to return a value and not all methods need input arguments.\n\n\nNOTE:\n Remote methods cannot be called until we have obtained\nan interface object from the ProxyBusObject class. Trying to\ncall a remote method before obtaining the interface could result\nin your application crashing. The mSampleInterface is a null object\nuntil we have connected it to the service using the\n\nProxyBusObject.getInterface()\n method.\n\n\nUsing AllJoyn signals\n\n\nSignals, unlike methods, never return a value. Client applications\nthat are interested in receiving a signal must register for that\nsignal with the bus. The client must implement a signal handler to\nrespond to the signal for which it has registered.\n\n\nCode 19. Example interface containing signals\n\n\n@BusInterface (name = \norg.sample.busSignals\n)\npublic interface SampleInterface {\n\n   @BusSignal\n   public void buttonClicked(int id) throws BusException;\n\n   @BusSignal\n   public void playerPosition(int x, int y, int z) throws BusException;\n}\n\n\n\n\nCode 20. Create an empty class implementation\n\n\nclass SignalInterface implements SampleInterface, BusObject {\n   public void buttonClicked(int id) {/*No code needed here*/}\n   public void playerPosition(int x, int y, int z){/*No code needed here*/}\n}\n\n\n\n\nA SignalEmitter is required to emit a signal. To create a SignalEmitter,\nyou must have a BusObject. The code above creates a BusObject that\nis aware of the bus signals found in the SampleInterface. Signals do not\nneed to have any code added to transmit a signal, you just inform the\nbus that a signal with a given interface exists.\n\n\nOnce a SignalEmitter is created, an interface can be made to\nsend the actual signals. No coding is needed to emit the signals\nbeyond defining and using the interface.\n\n\nCode 21. Connect signals to the bus and emitting the signals - service\n\n\nprivate static final short CONTACT_PORT=42;\nstatic int sessionId;\nstatic String joinerName;\n\nboolean sessionEstablished = false;\n\nBusAttachment mBus;\nmBus = new BusAttachment(\nAppName\n, BusAttachment.RemoteMessage.Receive);\nSignalInterface mySignalInterface = new SignalInterface();\n\nStatus status = mBus.registerBusObject(mySignalInterface, \n/MyService/Path\n);\nif (status != Status.OK) {\n   System.exit(0);\n   return;\n}\n\nstatus = mBus.connect();\nif (status != Status.OK) {\n   System.exit(0);\n   return;\n}\n\nint flags = 0; //do not use any request name flags\nstatus = mBus.requestName(\ncom.my.well.known.name\n, flags);\nif (status != Status.OK) { System.exit(0);\nreturn;\n}\n\nstatus = mBus.advertiseName(\ncom.my.well.known.name\n,\n   SessionOpts.TRANSPORT_ANY);\nif (status != Status.OK) {\n   System.out.println(\nStatus = \n + status);\n   mBus.releaseName(\ncom.my.well.known.name\n);\n   System.exit(0);\n   return;\n}\n\nMutable.ShortValue contactPort = new Mutable.ShortValue(CONTACT_PORT);\nSessionOpts sessionOpts = new SessionOpts();\nsessionOpts.traffic = SessionOpts.TRAFFIC_MESSAGES;\nsessionOpts.isMultipoint = false;\nsessionOpts.proximity = SessionOpts.PROXIMITY_ANY;\nsessionOpts.transports = SessionOpts.TRANSPORT_ANY;\n\nstatus = mBus.bindSessionPort(contactPort, sessionOpts,\n   new SessionPortListener() {\n   public boolean acceptSessionJoiner(short sessionPort, String joiner,\n      SessionOpts sessionOpts) {\n   if (sessionPort == CONTACT_PORT) {\n   return true;\n   } else {\n   return false;\n   }\n\n   }\n   public void sessionJoined(short sessionPort, int id, String joiner) {\n      sessionId = id; joinerName = joiner; sessionEstablished = true;\n   }\n});\n\ntry {\nwhile (!sessionEstablished) {\n   Thread.sleep(10);\n}\n\nSignalEmitter emitter = new SignalEmitter(mySignalInterface, joinerName,\n   sessionId,\nSignalEmitter.GlobalBroadcast.Off);\nmyInterface = emitter.getInterface(SampleInterface.class);\n// Emitting signals myInterface.buttonClicked(1);\nmyInterface.playerPosition(12, 1, -24);\n\n} catch (InterruptedException ex) {\n  System.out.println(\nInterrupted\n);\n} catch (BusException ex) {\nSystem.out.println(\nBus Exception: \n + ex.toString());\n}\n\n\n\n\nCode 22. Registering signal handlers - client\n\n\nstatus = mBus.registerSignalHandlers(this);\nif (status != Status.OK) {\n   System.exit(0);\n   return;\n}\n\n\n\n\nWhen registering for signal handlers, you must implement a\nclass that contains a method with the @BusSignalHandler annotation.\nIn \nCode 22. Registering signal handlers - client\n, the signal\nhandler would need to be in the same class. If needed, a\ndifferent class can be used to handle the signals; just\nput that class as an argument for the registerSignalHandlers method.\n\n\nCode 23. Adding signal handlers - client\n\n\n@BusSignalHandler(iface=\norg.sample.busSignals\n, signal=\nbuttonClicked\n)\npublic void buttonClicked(int id) {\n   switch(id)\n   case 0:\n      startNewGame();\n      break;\n   case 1:\n\n      continueGame();\n      break;\n   case 2:\n      quitGame();\n      break;\n   default:\n      break;\n}\n\n@BusSignalHandler(iface=\norg.sample.busSignals\n, signal=\nplayerPosition\n)\npublic void playerPosition(int x, int y, int z) {\nupdatePlayerPosition(x,y,z);\n}\n\n\n\n\nThe important part of the BusSignalHandler is to get the\niface name and the signal arguments correct. If these are not\ncorrect, it does not catch the emitted signal. The function name\nitself is not important; it could be changed from\n\npublic void buttonClicked(int id)\n to \npublic void foo(int id)\n\nand it would still catch the \"buttonClicked\" signal.\n\n\nSessionless signals\n\n\nA signal is a way to send one-way acknowledgment data from\none peer to another or to multiple peers. However, when sending\na signal we typically need to be a part of a session.\nThere are many use cases where using a session to send a signal\nwould be unnecessary overhead. For example, when you want to\ninform a peer, who is not in session with you, of a changed state\nof information. This works two ways, with a peer specifying\nwhether he wants to receive such notifications and with the\npeer who is sending out this notification to anyone who subscribed for it.\n\n\nIt should be noted that there are performance limitations that need to be understood:\n\n\n\n\nA sessionless signal is not a replacement for using a session,\nit is a shortcut to help avoid logic of setting up a session to\ntransmit small amounts of data.\n\n\nEach sessionless signal will replace the previous one.\nIf the receiving side has not had a chance to pull the data,\nit will be lost and not transmitted to the other side.\n\n\nPer number 2, the design of a sessionless signal is not\nto be used for File Transfer or frequent game play updates.\nThe design is for static information such as device details,\na player profile, or informing another application to invite\nto a session or trigger an action.\n\n\nAll sessionless signals have an overhead of creating and\ntearing down a connection which can cause unnecessary network\nchatter if used improperly for sending frequent data.\n\n\n\n\nThe way to send sessionless signals is not much different\nthan sending a regular signal. Just set the flag specifying\nthat it is a sessionless signal and set the session id used\nto send the signal to 0 since we are not a part of a session\nwhen we send this out.\n\n\nA sessionless signal does not need a session id - thus the name.\nThe sample showing this simple feature is under \nSDK/java/samples/sessionless\n.\n\n\nAlong the lines of the above-mentioned sample, let us assume\nthat a client peer is sending out sessionless signals. A service peer\nis the one that has subscribed for these signals/notifications.\n\n\nTwo things to know in the case of a sessionless signal is that:\n\n\n\n\nIt has a session id of 0.\n\n\nIt has the sessionless flag set to indicate that it is a\nsessionless signal.\n\n\n\n\nThis case can look like the following:\n\n\nSignalEmitter emitter = new SignalEmitter(mySignalService, 0,\nSignal.GlobalBroadcast.Off);\nemitter.setSessionlessFlag(true);\n\n\n\n\nThe service side, which wants to receive these sessionless signals,\ncalls an \naddMatch()\n function and passes in the rule for\nsessionless signals. This looks like (where \"my.signal.Service\"\nbelow is the name of the interface emitting the sessionless signal):\n\n\nStatus status = mBus.addMatch(\ninterface=;my.signal.Service',sessionless='t'\n);\n\n\n\n\nThat is all we need. The service side would have the signal handler\nfor the signal sent by the client. No advertisements, no binding,\nor joining of sessions is necessary by any side.\n\n\nUsing AllJoyn properties\n\n\nAllJoyn properties may be viewed as a specialized case of AllJoyn methods.\nAn AllJoyn property must start with the word \"get\" or \"set\".\nIf it starts with the word \"get\", it must return a single value\nand take no arguments. If it starts with the word \"set\",\nit must take a single parameter and return void. The parameter\ncan be a complex data type like an array or a structure.\nThis code should closely resemble the code used for AllJoyn methods.\n\n\nCode 24. Interface using properties\n\n\n@BusInterface (name = \norg.samples.properties\n)\npublic interface PropertiesInterface {\n   @BusProperty\n   public int getTextSize() throws BusException;\n   @BusProperty\n   public void setTextSize(int size) throws BusException;\n}\n\n\n\n\nCode 25. Implementation of the PropertiesInterface - service\n\n\nclass AllJoynProperties implements PropertiesInterface, BusObject {\n   private int mTextSize;\n\n   public int getTextSize() {\n      return mTextSize;\n   }\n\n   public void setTextSize(int size) {\n      mTextSize = size;\n   }\n}\n\n\n\n\nCode 26. Connecting the Properties interface to the bus - service\n\n\nprivate BusAttachment mBus;\nmBus = new BusAttachment(getClass().getName(),\nBusAttachment.RemoteMessage.Receive);\n\nAllJoynProperties mProperties = new AllJoynProperties();\nStatus status = mBus.registerBusObject(mProperties, \n/testProperties\n);\nif (status != Status.OK) {\n   System.exit(0);\n   return;\n}\n\n\n\n\nThe D-Bus standard provides a way to get all of the properties\nfrom an interface. The code below shows how to use the interface\nimplemented in \nCode 25. Implementation of the PropertiesInterface - service\n,\nas well as the \nGetAll method\n from the D-Bus standard to\nget the \nTextSize\n property.\n\n\nNOTE:\n The GetAll method can return multiple values into a Map.\nEach property can be accessed using the name of the property.\n\n\nCode 27. Calling the properties interface and using the GetAll method for properties\n\n\nprivate BusAttachment mBus;\nprivate ProxyBusObject mProxyObj;\nprivate PropertiesInterface mPropertiesInterface;\nprivate Properties mProperties;\nprivate static short CONTACT_PORT = 42;\n\nprivate boolean isJoined = false;\n\nmBus = new BusAttachment(getClass().getName(),\nBusAttachment.RemoteMessage.Receive);\n\nmBus.registerBusListener(new BusListener {\n   public void foundAdvertisedName(String name, short transport,\nString namePrefix) {\n\n   short contactPort = CONTACT_PORT;\n   SessionOpts sessionOpts = new SessionOpts();\n   sessionOpts.traffic = SessionOpts.TRAFFIC_MESSAGES;\n   sessionOpts.isMultipoint = false;\n   sessionOpts.proximity = SessionOpts.PROXIMITY_ANY;\n   sessionOpts.transports = SessionOpts.TRANSPORT_ANY;\n\n   Mutable.IntegerValue sessionId = new Mutable.IntegerValue();\n\n   Status status = mBus.joinSession(name, contactPort, sessionId, sessionOpts,\nnew SessionListener());\n   if (status != Status.OK) {\n   System.exit(0);\n   }\n   mProxyObj =  mBus.getProxyBusObject(\ncom.my.well.known.name\n,\n      \n/testProperties\n,\n      sessionId.value,\n      new Class\n?\n[] { PropertiesInterface.class,\n         Properties.class });\n\n   mPropertiesInterface = mProxyObj.getInterface(PropertiesInterface.class);\n   mProperties = mProxyObj.getInterface({Properties.class);\n   isJoined = true;\n}\n});\nStatus status = mBus.connect();\nif (Status.OK != status) {\n   System.exit(0);\n   return;\n}\n\nstatus = mBus.findAdvertisedName(\ncom.my.well.known.name\n);\nif (status != Status.OK) {\n   System.exit(0);\n}\n\nwhile(!isJoined) {\n   try { Thread.sleep(10);\n   } catch (InterruptedException e) {\n   System.out.println(\nProgram interupted\n);\n   }\n}\n\nmPropertiesInterface.setTextSize(18);\nint textSize = mPropertiesInterface.getTextSize();\n\nMap\nString, Variant\n map = mProperties.GetAll(\norg.samples.properties\n);\ntextSize = map.get(\nTextSize\n).getObject(Integer.class);\n\n\n\n\nSecurity\n\n\nWhen an interface is marked as \"secure\", it indicates that all\ndata sent via a method call or signal must be encrypted.\nOnly an authenticated client can use an interface that has\nbeen marked as secure by using the @Secure annotation\n(see [Making a secure bus interface using the @Secure annotation][make-secure-bus-interface-using-secure-annotation]).\n\n\nMarking an interface as a secure interface is as simple as\nadding the annotation @Secure when declaring the interface.\nSee \nCode 5. Creating a secure interface\n.\n\n\nIt possible to use security and authentication with interfaces\nthat do not have the @Secure annotation. This is possible using Object Security.\n\n\nObject security\n\n\nObject Security allows you to force peer authentication\neven when the interface does not have the @Secure annotation.\nIt's possible to tell the AllJoyn framework that you want\nauthentication when you register a your BusObject.\n\n\nCode 28. Registering an BusObject using Object Security\n\n\nbus.registerBusObject(myService, \n/my/object/path\n, true);\n\n\n\n\nThe ProxyBusObject should also indicate that it is using peer authentication.\n\n\nCode 29. Get a ProxyBusObject that uses Object Security\n\n\nbus.getProxyBusObject(\nmy.wellknown.name\n, \n/my/object/path\n,\nsessionId, new Class\n?\n[] {MyInterface.class}, true);\n\n\n\n\nFor both the \nregisterBusObject\n and \ngetProxyBusObject\n methods,\nan extra Boolean argument can be added to the method calls.\nIf this is 'true', then peer authentication is used.\n\n\nThe programmer is responsible for making sure that both the\nBusObject and ProxyBusObject are using Object security. .\nIf the BusObject is created as a secure object, the ProxyBusObject\nshould also be secure. If they do not agree, it is an error.\n\n\nAllJoyn authentication mechanisms\n\n\nWhen using a secure interface, an authentication listener\nmust be created to handle authentication events. The authentication\nlistener provides authentication credentials for the local application\nand, depending on the authentication mechanism, checks the credential\nof the remote application.\n\n\nThe AllJoyn framework supports the following types of authentication mechanisms:\n\n\n\n\nSecure Remote Password (SRP) anonymous key exchange\n\n\nSecure Remote Password (SRP) logon (username and password)\n\n\nRSA key exchange using X509 certificates\n\n\nPIN key exchange\n\n\nECDHE_NULL key exchange\n\n\nECDHE_PSK key exchange\n\n\nECDHE_ECDSA key exchange\n\n\n\n\nSRP key exchange uses a one-time authenticating password to\nset up an authentication key. This key is used for all subsequent\ninteractions between the client and server.\n\n\nSRP logon requires that the user give a username and password\nbefore the client and server are able to share an interface,\nunlike the SRP key exchange where the password exchange is a\none-time event. SRP logon requires the username and password\nbe supplied each time a session is established between the\nclient and server.\n\n\nRSA key exchange uses RSA public key cryptography to establish\na shared-secret passphrase. The shared-secret passphrase is\nused to establish a key. This key is then used for all subsequent\nexchanges between the given client and server using the protocol.\n\n\nPIN key exchange uses a one-time authenticating password to\nset up an authentication key. This key is used for all subsequent\ninteractions between the client and server. PIN key exchange\nis specifically designed for devices that have really stringent\nmemory constrains like MCUs (Micro Control Units). Unless you are\ncommunicating with an MCU, it is recommended that you use an\nauthentication mechanism other than PIN key exchange.\n\n\nECDHE_NULL is an Elliptic Curve Diffie-Hellman Ephemeral key\nexchange which is anonymous.\n\n\nECDHE_PSK is an Elliptic Curve Diffie-Hellman Ephemeral key\nexchange which uses a pre-shared key like a PIN, a passphrase,\nor a symmetric key.\n\n\nECDHE_ECDSA is an Elliptic Curve Diffie-Hellman Ephemeral key\nexchange which uses a key agreement authenticated with an\nasymmetric key, and validated with an Elliptic Curve Digital\nSignature Algorithm (ECDSA) signature.\n\n\nEach type of security mechanism requires that an Authentication\nListener be created that handles the specific type of security\nexchange needed. When creating the Authentication Listener, you\nspecify which type of authentication mechanism you want to use.\nEach authentication mechanism is specified by a string.\n\n\nAuthentication mechanisms and AllJoyn identifying string\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAuthentication mechanism\n\n\nString identifying the authentication mechanism\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSRP anonymous key exchange\n\n\nALLJOYN_SRP_KEYX\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSRP logon\n\n\nALLJOYN_SRP_LOGON\n\n\n\n\n\n\nRSA key exchange\n\n\nALLJOYN_RSA_KEYX\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPIN key exchange ALLJOYN_PIN_KEYX\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nECDHE_NULL key exchange\n\n\nALLJOYN_ECDHE_NULL\n\n\n\n\n\n\nECDHE_PSK key exchange\n\n\nALLJOYN_ECDHE_PSK\n\n\n\n\n\n\nECDHE_ECDSA key exchange\n\n\nALLJOYN_ECDHE_ECDSA\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe AuthListener\n\n\nThe main difference between a secure application and a\nplain application, besides the @Secure annotation of the\ninterfaces, is the required inclusion of an AuthListener.\nAn implementation of an AuthListener contains two callback methods:\n\n\n\n\nRequested\n\n\nCompleted\n\n\n\n\nAny time a method call comes in on a secure interface,\nthe AllJoyn framework checks to see if it already knows how\nto decrypt the contents of the method call. If it cannot decrypt\nthe method call, the \nrequested(...)\n method call is called.\n\n\nThe requested method call contains some or all of the following information:\n\n\n\n\nThe Authentication mechanism specified using one of the strings from\n\nAuthentication mechanisms and AllJoyn identifying string\n.\n\n\nPeerName - the well-known-name or unique name of the peer that initiated the\nAuthentication request.\n\n\nA count of the number of authentication request attempts made.\n  The count for the first Authentication request starts at 1.\n\n\nThe user name of the user making the authentication request.\n  A user name is not required for all forms of authentications\n  and may be an empty string.\n\n\nThe specific type of authentication information being requested.\n  Depending on what type of authentication mechanism is being used,\n  one or more of these requests may be made:\n\n\nCertificateRequest (RSA key exchange or ECDHE_ECDSA key exchange)\n\n\nLogonEntryRequest (SRP logon)\n\n\nPasswordRequest (SRP key exchange, SRP logon, RSA key exchange,\n    PIN key exchange, or ECDHE_PSK key exchange)\n\n\nPrivateKeyRequest (RSA key exchange or ECDHE_ECDSA key exchange)\n\n\nUserNameRequest (SRP logon)\n\n\nVerifyRequest (RSA key exchange or ECDHE_ECDSA key exchange)\n\n\n\n\nThe \nrequested(...)\n callback method may be called one or\nmore times for each authentication request. For each request,\nthe program is expected to obtain or generate the required\ninformation. The requested information can be obtained from any\nsource available including requesting information from a user.\nIf the requested information cannot be provided then returning\nfalse indicates failure.\n\n\nOnce the authentication has finished the \ncompleted(...)\n\ncallback method is called. This contains:\n\n\n\n\nThe authentication mechanism that was just completed\n\n\nThe peerName (well-known name or unique name)\n\n\nA boolean variable indicating if the authentication attempt completed successfully.\n\n\n\n\nAs we talk about each authentication method, message sequence\ncharts are provided showing method calls and callbacks used\nto set up the authenticated session. A legend for the\nMessage Sequence Chart (MSC) is provided in the following figure.\n\n\n\n\nFigure: Message Sequence Chart legend\n\n\nThe message sequence charts simplify all device-to-device\ncommunication by ignoring bus traffic. All AllJoyn bus traffic\nis compressed into a single line in the message sequence charts\nlabeled \"AllJoyn Bus.\" This shows only the callbacks and\nmethod calls that we should be interested in when setting up authentication.\n\n\nCode for SRP key exchange\n\n\nSRP key exchange works similarly to pairing Bluetooth devices.\nThe devices advertise that they want to talk with one another\nand when they discover one another a password is entered on\nthe device. This one-time password proves that the device knows\nabout the Bluetooth device. Once this one-time pairing is completed,\nthe Bluetooth device can connect with the device at any time\nwithout repeating the pairing process.\n\n\nCode 30. Registering the authentication listener\n\nsets up a client/server that uses SRP key exchange to set up\na secure connection. The code shares many similarities with\npairing a Bluetooth device.\n\n\n\n\nThere is a one-time password exchange.\n\n\nOnce the authentication is completed the client and server\ncan communicate without asking for passwords to be entered.\n\n\nEven after the program is closed and restarted, the\nauthentication is still valid.\n\n\n\n\nThe following figure shows the sequence in which the callback\nmethods are instantiated the first time a secure method call\nis made using SRP key exchange. The sequence shown only happens\nthe first time the sender tries to communicate with the receiver.\n\n\n\n\nFigure: MSC SRP key exchange\n\n\nIn \nCode 30. Registering the authentication listener\n,\nthe sender is the client and the receiver is the service.\n\n\nBefore calling connect, the \nBusAttachment.registerAuthListener()\n\nshould be called. The code snippet below shows registering an\nAuthListener with the name SrpKeyXListener. The code for the\nSrpKeyXListener is shown in \nCode 31.

We can see the number\nof times the user has tried to authenticate by looking at the\ncount parameter.

The one-time password\nentered by the user must match the six-digit PIN code that was\nrandomly generated by the service. The user is given three attempts\nto provide the proper PIN code. If the user is unable to provide\nthe PIN code, the authentication attempt fails. Just like the code\nused in the service's SrpKeyXListener, we also check to see what\n\ninstanceof\n AuthRequest we have received. Since we are using\nSRP key exchange, we are only expecting password requests.\nThe base \nAuthRequest\n type is cast to a \nPasswordRequest\n\ntype and the password is set using the \nsetPassword\n method.\nUnlike the service, this code limits the number of attempts\nthe user is given to produce the proper PIN code. After three\nfailed attempts, this returns false indicating failure to\ncomplete authentication.\n\n\nCode for SRP logon\n\n\nSRP logon uses the familiar user name/password method for\nidentity verification. This should be familiar to anyone\nwho has used online shopping, email, or banking.\n\n\nUnlike SRP key exchange and RSA key exchange, SRP logon requires\nthe user to enter the user name/password every time a session\nis established. The verification only lasts for the length of\nthe session. If the program is shut down and then restarted,\nthe user is asked to re-authenticate.\n\n\n\n\nFigure: MSC SRP logon option 1\n\n\n\n\nFigure: MSC SRP logon option 2\n\n\n\n\nFigure: MSC SRP logon option 3\n\n\n\n\nFigure: MSC SRP logon option 4\n\n\nWith SRP logon, there are four possible sequence diagrams.\nWhen the sender is requested to provide a user name or password,\nthey can provide just the user name or both the user name and password.\nThe information is sent to the receiver and the receiver then\nuses the user name to look up the password or logon. If the password\nwas also supplied and matches the receiver's password or the\ncomputer logon, the authentication completes. If only the\nuser name was supplied, the receiver then requests the user name\nand password from the sender.\n\n\nWhat is the logon? The logon is a string that is computed\nusing the process described in \nRFC 5054\n.\nThis ends up being a large string that takes the form of \nN:g:s:v\n where:\n\n\n\n\nN is a large prime number\n\n\ng is the generator\n\n\ns is the salt\n\n\nv is the computed verifier\n\n\n\n\nThe logon gives all the information needed to compute the\nverifier from the user name and password. This is a strongly\nencrypted string that can be used to verify a user name and\npassword but cannot be used to obtain the user name and password.\nBecause it is a secure way to store a user name and password,\nmany databases do not actually store the password but instead\nstore the logon as defined by \nRFC 5054\n.\nComputing the logon string is beyond the scope of this document.\n\nCode 33. Registering the authentication listener for SRP logon\n\nuses plain text user name and password.\n\n\nWhen using a secure interface, an authentication listener\nmust be created that handles authentication. The authentication\nlistener decides if the connecting client is a trusted client\nand if they should be allowed to use the interface. The implementation\nof the SrpLogonListener is shown in\n\nCode 33. Registering the authentication listener for SRP logon\n.\nSee \nCode 34. SRP Logon AuthListener - service\n\nfor the service (receiver) and \nCode 34. SRP Logon AuthListener - service\n\nfor the client (sender).\n\n\nCode 33.

SRP Logon AuthListener - service\n\n\nclass SrpLogonListener implements AuthListener {\n   private Map\nString, char[]\n mUserNamePassword;\n\n   /* Populate the user name and password table used by this listener. */\n   public SrpLogonListener() {\n      mUserNamePassword = new HashMap\nString, char[]\n();\n      mUserNamePassword.put(\nuser1\n, \npassword1\n.toCharArray());\n      mUserNamePassword.put(\nuser2\n, \npassword2\n.toCharArray());\n   }\n\n   /*\n    * Given the user name, look up the password.

Since only passwords are provided,\nthe \nLogonEntryRequest\n has been ignored. The sample above has\ncreated a HashMap that contains two user names and two passwords.\nWhen the \nrequested()\n callback method is called, it contains\nthe user name that can be used to obtain the password from the\nHashMap. If the password matches the password provided by\nthe client, the authentication is completed. If a password\nwas not provided, the client is asked to once again provide\na user name and password. If the service is unable to obtain\nthe password from the user name, it requests the user name and password again.\n\n\nCode 35. SRP Logon AuthListener - client\n\n\nclass SrpLogonListener implements AuthListener {\n\nstatic class SrpLogonListener implements AuthListener {\n   public boolean requested(String mechanism,\n         String peerName,\n         int count,\n         String userName,\n         AuthRequest[] requests) {\n   /*\n    * Collect the requests we're interested in to simplify\n    * processing below.\n    */\n   PasswordRequest passwordRequest = null;\n   UserNameRequest userNameRequest = null;\n   for (AuthRequest request : requests) {\n      if (request instanceof PasswordRequest) {\n         passwordRequest = (PasswordRequest) request;\n      } else if (request instanceof UserNameRequest) {\n         userNameRequest = (UserNameRequest) request;\n      }\n   }\n\n   if (count \n= 3) {\n      System.out.print(\nPlease enter user name [user1]: \n);\n      Scanner in = new Scanner(System.in);\n      String user = in.nextLine();\n\n      System.out.print(\nPlease enter password [password1]: \n);\n      String password = in.nextLine();\n\n      userNameRequest.setUserName(user);\n      passwordRequest.setPassword(password.toCharArray());\n      return true;\n   }\n   return false;\n}\n\npublic void completed(String authMechanism,\n      String authPeer,\n      boolean authenticated) {\n   if (!authenticated) {\n      System.out.println(\nAuthentication failed.\n);\n   }\n}\n}\n\n\n\n\nThe \nrequested()\n method requests both the \nPasswordRequest\n\nand the \nUserNameRequest\n. Here we have asked the user to\nenter both user name and password. Since this is sample code,\nwe are also revealing the user name and password which\nnormally would not be done unless it is a guest account.\nIf the supplied user name and password match the user name\nand password at the server, the authentication completes.\nIf the user name and password do not match, the user gets\nup to three tries to enter the correct user name and password\nbefore the authentication fails.\n\n\nCode for RSA key exchange\n\n\nRSA is an encryption method that has been successfully used\nfor online commerce for years. It consists of the exchange of\nwhat is called a public key. The public key can be used to\nencrypt data but cannot be used to decrypt the data. To be able\nto decrypt the data, the receiver would use their private key.\nIf the data were encrypted using their public key, they can read\nthe data contents but no one else can. To make private keys\neven more secure, they are typically encrypted using a password.\nTo decrypt the private key, the password must be known.\n\n\nThe RSA key exchange certificate chain requires three things:\n\n\n\n\nA private key\n\n\nA password used to encrypt the private key\n\n\nAn X.509 certificate (a standard public key structure)\n\n\n\n\nThe X.509 certificate contains the public key as well as\nadditional information such as who issued the key and\nhow long the key is valid.\n\n\nIf you have the three required elements, you can provide them\nto the AuthListener when they are \nrequested()\n. If you have\nnot generated the required elements, the code can automatically\ngenerate them for you.\n\n\n\n\nFigure: MSC RSA key exchange option 1\n\n\nFor this option, both sender and receiver have all the full\nRSA certificate chain needed: their own private keys, certificates,\nand the password used for private key encryption. When the sender\ncalls the remote method call to an unverified receiver, the sender\nis asked to provide the RSA certificate chain. Once the RSA\ncertificate chain has been provided, the receiver also requests\nthe RSA certificate chain. The receiver then sends out a verify\nrequest. This gives the receiver an opportunity to inspect the\ncertificate sent from the sender. The receiver can inspect the\ncertificate and accept or reject the certificate based on\ninformation such as who issued the certificate.\n\n\n\n\nFigure: MSC RSA key exchange option 2\n\n\nFor this option the sender does not have the RSA certificate\nchain needed for RSA authentication. The code can generate a\nself-signed RSA private key and X.509 certificate for the user.\nThe user only needs to supply the password needed to encrypt the\nprivate key. If multiple authentication requests are made,\nthe sender reuses the private key and certificate generated.\nIt is important that each additional request for password\nuses the same password. If a different password is supplied,\nyou receive an error stating that you are unable to decrypt\nthe RSA private key. It is possible to find out if this is\nthe first time the password is being generated by calling\n\nAuthListener.PasswordRequest.isNewPassword()\n method.\n\n\n\n\nFigure: MSC RSA key exchange option 3\n\n\nIn this option, neither the sender nor the receiver have the\nRSA elements or they were already generated. Both sides ask\nfor their private key password. The sender and receiver can\nchoose differing passwords since the password is only used\nfor their own private key which is not shared with the other device.\n\n\n\n\nFigure 10: MSC RSA key exchange option 4\n\n\nWith this option the receiver side generates its own private key and certificate.\n\n\nWhen using a secure interface, an authentication listener must\nbe created that handles connection authentication. The authentication\nlistener decides if the connecting client is a trusted client\nand if they should be allowed to use the interface.\n\n\nCode 36. Registering the authentication listener\n\n\nBusAttachment mBus;\nmBus = new BusAttachment( \nMyAppName\n, BusAttachment.RemoteMessage.Receive);\n\nRsaKeyXListener mAuthListener;\n\nStatus status = mBus.registerAuthListener(\nALLJOYN_RSA_KEYX\n,\n   mAuthListener);\nif (status != Status.OK) {\n   finish();\n   return;\n}\n\n\n\n\nThe rest of the steps for connecting and advertising the service\nare detailed in \nDiscovery and sessions\n\nand are unchanged for a secure interface.\n\n\nCode 37.

This code does not\nprovide the private key or the X.509 certificate but still\nreturns true for the CertificateRequest. The code tries to\nsee if it has already generated a private key and a self-signed\ncertificate. If it has generated a private key and a self-signed\ncertificate, it asks for the password that was used to generate\nthe key and certificate. If it has not generated a private key\nand self-signed certificate, it asks for a password to do so.\nIn both instances you receive a PasswordRequest. The only way\nto tell if the private key and certificate have already been\ngenerated is to check if this is a request for a new password:\n\npasswordRequest.isNewPassword()\n. It is important to remember\nthe password, because the same password is expected on each\nadditional authentication attempt. Both the client and the\nservice handle RSA authentication identically, and there is\nno difference between the service \nAuthListener\n and the\nclient \nAuthListener\n.\n\n\nIf you do not want the AllJoyn framework generating your\nprivate key and X.509 certificate for you, then you need to\nprovide the private key, the password used to encrypt the\nprivate key, and the X.509 certificate. For the following sample,\nthe private key and certificate were generated using openssl.\nFor most systems, openssl is required to run the AllJoyn framework.\nYou might already have it installed on your system (openssl is\nnot required for all installations of Windows). Many other tools\nare available to create the private key and certificate;\nif you are familiar with those tools feel free to use them.\n\n\nSee openssl's documentation for creating keys and certificates:\n\n\nhttp://www.openssl.org/docs/HOWTO/keys.txt\n\n\nhttp://www.openssl.org/docs/HOWTO/certificates.txt\n\n\nTo create a private key the following command was used:\n\n\n$ openssl genrsa -des3 -out privkey.pem 2048\n\n\n\n\nYou are asked to enter a pass phrase; the pass phrase \"pass\" was chosen.\n\n\nThis generates a private key that is 2048 bits in length.\n2048 or higher is recommended for RSA keys.\n\n\nThe private key is then used to generate the X.509 certificate\n\n\n$ openssl req -new -x509 -key privkey.pem -out cacert.pem -days 3650\n\n\n\n\nYou are asked to provide the following for the certificate:\n\n\n\n\nThe pass phrase for privkey.pem\n\n\nCountry name (2 letter code)\n\n\nState or province name (full name)\n\n\nLocality name (e.g., city)\n\n\nOrganization name\n\n\nOrganization unit name\n\n\nCommon name (e.g., YOUR name)\n\n\nEmail address\n\n\n\n\nThis certificate is valid for just under 10 years from the date\nof its creation.

If we register the\nAuthListener using the two-parameter method, we are using\nthe default keystore listener with its default options.\nThis uses a default location for storing the keystore.\nThe name of the keystore is the same as the application\nname that was used when creating the new BusAttachment.\nThe default location for the keystore differs depending\non the operating system that is being used. The default\nlocation chosen is a location that the user has permission\nto read and write from.\n\n\nFor Windows XP, the file is in:\n\n\nC:\\Documents and Settings\\\nuser_name\n\\.alljoyn_keystore\\\nApplication name\n\n\n\n\n\nFor Windows 7, the file is in:\n\n\nC:\\Users\\\nuser_name\n\\.alljoyn_keystore\\\nApplication name\n\n\n\n\n\nFor Linux, the file is in:\n\n\n/home/\nuser_name\n/.alljoyn_keystore/\nApplication name\n\n\n\n\n\nThe default location and name of the keystore file can be\nchanged by providing a third parameter. The third parameter\ncan be used to specify the location where the keystore is\nwritten. Note that the location provided as the third parameter\nwhen registering the AuthListener is appended to the location\nof the home folder for the OS being used. The code must\nhave read/write permissions to access that location.\n\n\nCode 47. Overriding the default file location when registering an AuthListener\n\n\nBusAttachment bus;\nbus = new BusAttachment(\nMyApp\n, BusAttachment.RemoteMessage.Receive);\nString strFilePath = File.separator + \nfoo\n + File.separator + \nfileName.ks\n;\nStatus status = mBus.registerAuthListener(\nALLJOYN_SRP_KEYX\n,\n   mAuthListener,\n   strFilePath);\n\n\n\n\nThis places the file in the users home directory in a folder\nnamed foo. The file is called fileName.ks.\n\n\n\n\nC:\\Documents and Settings\\\nuser_name\n\\foo\\fileName.ks\n (Windows XP)\n\n\nC:\\Users\\\nuser_name\n\\foo\\fileName.ks\n (Windows 7)\n\n\n/home/\nuser_name\n/foo/fileName.ks\n (Linux)\n\n\n\n\nNOTE:\n The three-parameter option should be used when registering\nan authListener in Android (see \nSecurity\n).\n\n\nMultiple applications can share a single keystore; however, the\ncode needs to know that the keystore is being shared between\nmultiple applications or it overrides changes made by other\napplications. To use a shared keystore you must specify that\nthe keystore is shared when registering the authListener.\n\n\nCode 48. Registering AuthListeners with a shared keystore\n\n\nBusAttachment bus;\nbus = new BusAttachment(\nMyApp\n, BusAttachment.RemoteMessage.Receive);\nString strFilePath = File.separator + \n.alljoyn_keystore\n + File.separator +\n\n   \nshared.ks\n;\nStatus status = mBus.registerAuthListener(\nALLJOYN_SRP_KEYX\n,\n   mAuthListener,\n   strFilePath,\n   true);\n\n\n\n\nEvery application that wants to share the same keystore should\npoint to the same keystore file and set the isShared option to\ntrue when registering an \nAuthListener\n.\n\n\nWhy would you want multiple applications to share a keystore file?\nThis allows you to set up a family of applications that authenticate\nas one. Once one of the applications has completed authentication,\nthen all of the applications can use the same set of keys.\nThis means that only one authentication request is needed,\neven though multiple applications use a secure interface.\nUnder the AllJoyn framework's default mode, authentication\nis done on an app-per-app basis, not as a family of applications.\n\n\nAllJoyn debug log output\n\n\nThe AllJoyn framework has a built-in logging system for\ninvestigating AllJoyn-related issues. Only critical log output\nis displayed when using the AllJoyn Release mode.\n\n\nTo enable AllJoyn debugging three things must be done:\n\n\n\n\nSet the OS Logging option (OS-specific).\n\n\nSet the Debug Level for the module(s) of interest (on\nthe router or the application).\n\n\nSet ER_DEBUG_* environment variable (only needed when\nlogging to \nstderr\n).\n\n\n\n\nThese can be accessed using the following method calls:\n\n\nBusAttachment.useOSLogging (Boolean useOSLog );\nBusAttachment.setDebugLevel(String module, int level);\nBusAttachment.setLogLevels(String logEnv);\nBusAttachnent.setDaemonDebug(String module, int level);\n\n\n\n\nSet OS-specific logging option\n\n\nThe \nBusAttachment.useOSLogging\n command results in different\nbehavior depending on what OS the AllJoyn code is running on,\nas shown in the following table.\n\n\nOS-specific logging behavior\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nOS\n\n\nTrue\n\n\nFalse\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nWindows\n\n\nDebugger Trace Log\n\n\nstderr\n\n\n\n\n\n\nWindows RT\n\n\nWin RT Trace Log\n\n\nWin RT File Log\n\n\n\n\n\n\nLinux\n\n\nstderr\n\n\nstderr\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAndroid\n\n\nLogCat\n\n\nstderr\n\n\n\n\n\n\nMac\n\n\nstderr\n\n\nstderr\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFor \nBusAttachment.useOSLogging(true)\n on Windows and Windows RT, see:\n\n\n\n\n\n\nOutputDebugString function\n (Windows)\nhttp://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/windows/desktop/aa363362(v=vs.85).aspx\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFor \nBusAttachment.useOSLogging(false)\n on Windows RT, a file named alljoyn.log\nwill be created in the user's \nDocuments\n directory.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSet debug level for modules\n\n\nThe AllJoyn framework has a large number of modules, with new\nmodules being added as it continues to be developed. Several module\nnames of interest are:\n\n\n\n\nALL - print all modules\n\n\nALLJOYN_JAVA - trace log for the JNI layer of the Java Bindings\n\n\nALLJOYN - trace of AllJoyn method calls\n\n\nALLJOYN_OBJ - trace of AllJoyn object to name service calls\n\n\nNS - the TCP name service\n\n\n\n\nEach module can print out four debug levels:\n\n High Level = 0b0001\n\n Debug Messages = 0b0010\n\n API Trace = 0b0100\n\n Data Dump = 0b1000\n\n\nAs a general rule, you want a debug level and all the debug\noptions below that option. For example:\n\n\n1 = \"High Level\"\n\n\n3 = \"High Level\" and \"Debug Messages\"\n\n\n7 = \"High Level\", \"Debug Messages\", and \"API trace\"\n\n\n15 = \"High Level\", \"Debug Messages\", \"API trace\", and \"Data Dump\"\n\n\nThe following code would print the High Level log for ALL\nof the AllJoyn modules and the API trace and below log\nfor the ALLJOYN module:\n\n\nBusAttachment.setDebugLevel(\nALL\n, 1);\nBusAttachment.setDebugLevel(\nALLJOYN\n, 7);\n\n\n\n\nThe same could be achieved using the following code:\n\n\nBusAttachment.setLogLevels(\nALL=1;ALLJOYN=7\n);\n\n\n\n\nIf your application is using a separate AllJoyn router\nor it is using the built-in name discovery/advertisement\nservices, the logs from this part of the AllJoyn framework\nwill not output logs unless you use the following call:\n\n\nBusAttachnent.setDaemonDebug(\nALL\n, 7);\n\n\n\n\nNOTE:\n There is an error debug level that is always printed\nand cannot be turned off.\n\n\nSet ER_DEBUG_* environment variable\n\n\nWhen logging to stderr, an environment variable must also\nbe specified to obtain the debug log. This is a consequence\nof the AllJoyn logging system being written in C++.\n\n\nNormally when using a C++ program the user would only need\nto specify the module they are interested in using environment\nvariables. For example:\n\n\nexport ER_DEBUG_ALLJOYN_OBJ=15\n\n\n\n\nWith Java you will generally use:\n* Linux\n  \nsh\n  export ER_DEBUG_ALL=15\n\n\n\n\nWindows\n\n\n\n\nbat\n  set ER_DEBUG_ALL=15\n\n\nLog output\n\n\nIf everything is set up as expected you should be log output as follows:\n\n\n````\n6710.723 DEBUG  THREAD  external    ...n\\os\\windows\\Thread.cc:352 |\n   Thread::Join() thread is dead [replyTimer]\n6710.724 HL_DBG THREAD  external    ...n\\os\\windows\\Thread.cc:185 |\n   Thread::~Thread() [replyTimer,738e6b0] started:3 running:3 stopped:0\n6710.725 DEBUG  ALLJOYN_JAVA external   ...a\\jni\\alljoyn_java.cc:3942 |\n   JBusAttachment::Connect(): Taking Bus Attachment authentication listener change lock\n6710.742 DEBUG  ALLJOYN_JAVA external   ...a\\jni\\alljoyn_java.cc:4145 |\n   JBusAttachment::EnablePeerSecurity()\n6710.743 TRACE  ALLJOYN external    ...e\\src\\BusAttachment.cc:359 |\n   BusAttachment::TryConnect to tcp:addr=127.0.0.1,port=9956\n6710.744 HL_DBG ALLJOYN external    ...ows\\ClientTransport.cc:136 |\n   ClientTransport::Connect(): tcp:addr=127.0.0.1,port=9956\nInitialized winsock\n6710.764 TRACE  NETWORK external    ...n\\os\\windows\\Socket.cc:164 |\n   Socket(addrFamily = 2, type = 1, sockfd = \n)\n6710.766 TRACE  NETWORK external    ...n\\os\\windows\\Socket.cc:188 |\n   Connect(sockfd = 612, remoteAddr = 127.0.0.1, remotePort = 9956)\n6711.827 HL_DBG ALLJOYN external    ...ows\\ClientTransport.cc:175 |\n   ClientTransport(): socket Connect() failed ER_CONN_REFUSED\n6711.828 TRACE  NETWORK external    ...n\\os\\windows\\Socket.cc:361 |\n   Close (sockfd = 612)\n6711.831 TRACE  ALLJOYN external    ...e\\src\\BusAttachment.cc:359 |\n   BusAttachment::TryConnect to null:\nUsing BundledRouter\n\n\n\nThere are five columns for each log message printed out:\n\n1.

Which line of source code printed the message \n|\n the debug message.\n\n## Android-Specific Considerations\n\n### UI thread vs. AllJoyn bus thread\n\nWhen Android starts a new activity, a thread is created that\ndraws all of the user interface elements on the screen.\nBy default, all code that is added to the activity also runs\nin the same thread. Android always expects the user interface\n(UI) to be responsive. If a function is called that takes too\nlong to process information, the application is terminated by\nAndroid simply because the UI was unresponsive.\n\nAllJoyn applications typically conform to the client/server model;\nthe application is either providing a service or requesting something\nfrom a service. The service could be on a remote device or on\nthe same device. There are no time guarantees when calling an\nAllJoyn method. For this reason, all calls to an AllJoyn method\nor signal must be done in a thread that is independent of the\nmain UI thread.\n\nThis could be done by creating a new thread each time you call\na signal or method associated with the AllJoyn framework.\nThis can result in many threads being created including all\nthe memory usage associated with each thread. If too many\nthreads are created, the application could quickly run out\nof memory and crash. This could easily happen if signals\nwere being used to constantly update something like a game.\n\nTo avoid using a separate thread for each AllJoyn call,\nwe suggest you create a Handler on a separate thread that\nqueues AllJoyn method and signal calls.\n\n### Using Handler Looper\n\nCreate an implementation of a Handler that takes a Looper\nas its initialization parameter.\n\n#### Code 49. BusHandler class that extends the Handler class\n\n```java\nclass BusHandler extends Handler {\n   public BusHandler(Looper looper) {\n      super(looper);\n   }\n\n   @Override\n   public void handleMessage(Message msg) {\n      switch (msg.what) {\n      default:\n         break;\n      }\n   }\n}\n\n\n\n\nNow all of the AllJoyn method calls and signal calls can be\nplaced inside the switch statement found in the \nhandleMessage\n method.\n\n\nAlmost all programs that use the AllJoyn framework need to\nimplement a connect case and a disconnect case, as well as a\ncase for each AllJoyn method, property, and signal.\n\n\nTo start the BusHandler, use the following code:\n\n\nCode 50. Starting the BusHandler class\n\n\nBusHandler mBusHandler;\nHandlerThread busThread = new HandlerThread(\nBusHandler\n);\nbusThread.start();\nmBusHandler = new BusHandler(busThread.getLooper());\n\n\n\n\nThe \n/java/samples folder in the Android SDK\ncontains a large number of samples that all show how to\nuse the BusHandler.\n\n\nSecurity\n\n\nIn the AllJoyn Java API, there are two \nBusAttachment.registerAuthListener(...)\n methods.\nOne takes two arguments, and the other takes three arguments.\nWhen registering the authentication listener, the one with\nthree arguments should be used. The third argument sets the\nname of the keystore. It is recommended to always set this\nto \ngetFileStreamPath(\"alljoyn_keystore\").getAbsolutePath()\n\nfor all Android programs.\n\n\nPeer Permission Check\n\n\nIn Android's security model, each application must request\npermission to access certain system resources. For example,\n\nandroid.permission.READ_CONTACTS\n is required to access\nthe contact information on an Android device.\n\n\nIn catering to the security model of Android, the AllJoyn framework\nallows the service to impose permission requirements on\nAllJoyn method/signal calls. If the service specifies the\npermission requirements on a call, the client must acquire\nthose permissions by declaring them in the \nAndroidManifest.xml\n\nin order to invoke the call. If a client has not added the\nproper permissions to the \nAndroidManifest.xml\n, the AllJoyn\nmethod/signal call made by the client is rejected. If it is\nan AllJoyn method call, the router sends back an error message\n\n(status = ER_ALLJOYN_ACCESS_PERMISSION_ERROR)\n to the caller.\nMultiple permissions should be concatenated into a single\nstring using a semicolon (;) as the delimiter, for example:\n\n\nandroid.permission.X;android.permission.Y\n\n\n\n\nBy using the access permission in the interface, we are\npreventing a client application from accessing data without\nalso requesting the same device permission level as the service.\n\n\nIMPORTANT:\n\n   The peer permission check model only applies when\n   the service/client are on the same device. If the service\n   and client are on different devices, the peer permission\n   check will have no effect. The device-to-device trust model\n   should be based on Authentication.\n\n\nAndroid's security model does not apply to other OSs. If the\n   AllJoyn framework is used to synch contact and calendar data\n   with a desktop computer, the computer is not expected to obtain\n   permission to read and write the calendar and contacts.\n   The application installed on the Android device that is\n   communicating with the computer would still be required to\n   have Android permissions to access the information of interest.\n\n\nCode 51. Adding the @AccessPermission annotation for an AllJoyn Java interface\n\n\n@BusInterface (name = \norg.alljoyn.bus.addressbook\n)\npublic interface AddressBookInterface {\n   /*\n    * The AccessPermission annotation signifies that this function uses\n    * system resources that require system permission\n    * \nandroid.permission.READ_CONTACTS\n. Thus\n    * the application should declare the required permissions in its\n    * manifest file. If there are more than one permission item,\n    * they should be separated by ';'.\n    */\n   @BusMethod(signature = \nsi\n, replySignature = \nr\n)\n   @AccessPermission(\nandroid.permission.READ_CONTACTS\n)\n   public Contact getContact(String name, int userId) throws BusException;\n\n   /*\n    * the replySignature indicates that this BusMethod will return an\n    * array of structs.\n    */\n   @BusMethod(replySignature = \nar\n)\n   @AccessPermission(\nandroid.permission.READ_CONTACTS\n)\n   public NameId[] getAllContactNames() throws BusException;\n}\n\n\n\n\nBundled Router (Deprecated)\n\n\nIf you are using AllJoyn framework 2.6, the concept of bundled\nrouter is no longer present. A developer can still get all the\nfunctionality that was available with bundled daemon in\nAllJoyn 2.3.6 but there is no requirement to add the additional\nlibrary (bundle.jar) to the Android app or to use the extra\ncalls that were explicitly needed to use bundle router.\nHowever, the function call\n\n\norg.alljoyn.bus.alljoyn.DaemonInit.PrepareDaemon(getApplicationContext());\n\n\n\n\nis now used for an entirely different purpose as explained in\n\nUsing ICE with the AllJoyn Framework\n.\n\n\nUsing ICE with the AllJoyn Framework\n\n\nThe AllJoyn framework does what it is supposed to do; wonderfully.\nHowever, it cannot control certain things like the network setup\nover which it talks. A common example is wireless isolation.\nWhat is wireless isolation?\n\n\nImagine yourself sitting in a coffee shop and wanting to play a\ngame with your friend that uses the AllJoyn framework. In a normal\nhome setup you would be connected to your home access point and\nthis would work seamlessly. In a coffee shop or public place the\nnetwork administrators set up the access points such that two peers\ncannot talk to each other directly. Things like multicast and\nbroadcast are disabled in the coffee shop to avoid bandwidth\nproblems for other users - something that could happen if a\nyoung college student were to set up his own peer-to-peer network\nin the coffee shop with his friends or use an application\n(not using the AllJoyn framework) which floods the network\nwith multicast/broadcast packets.\n\n\nThe philosophy of the AllJoyn framework is to make it unnecessary\nfor the developer to be aware of such network complexities and\nstill achieve what the AllJoyn framework originally delivers - easy\nservice discovery and connectivity without having to change\nanything depending on the network or platform. To overcome\nthe problem of wireless isolation, we added in a parallel\ntransport in the AllJoyn framework that we call ICE.\nICE makes sure that you are able to discover services/devices\nand connect to them even if the access point you are connected\nto does not allow this to happen directly through it.\n\n\nICE is not only a way to solve the wireless isolation problem,\nit also provides another means to detect proximity with other\ndevices to aid in service discovery. To do this ICE needs to\nknow the list of access points around you. It does this by\ntalking to the Android framework from your AllJoyn app.\nFor this reason you need to specify the call:\n\n\norg.alljoyn.bus.alljoyn.DaemonInit.PrepareDaemon(getApplicationContext());\n\n\n\n\nAn ideal place to call this is just before you create a\nBusAttachment in your Android application. The application context\nis required so that the internal AllJoyn Java framework can\nget a list of access points around you by talking to the Android framework.\n\n\nPermissions to Add to your AllJoyn Android App\n\n\nUnder the hood, the AllJoyn framework does a lot of different\nthings on different platforms for device discovery without\nmaking the developer aware of the complexities involved.\nOn Android, it requires that the developer of the app grant\nthe app a set of four permissions so that the AllJoyn discovery works seamlessly.\n\n\nThe two permissions below are required because traditionally\nthe AllJoyn framework uses multicast for device discovery and\nthe Android framework requires any app that intends to use\nmulticast to have these permissions.\n\n\nuses-permission\nandroid:name=\nandroid.permission.INTERNET\n/uses-permission\n\n\n\nuses-permission\nandroid:name=\nandroid.permission.CHANGE_WIFI_MULTICAST_STATE\n/uses-permission\n\n\n\n\n\nThe two permissions below are required when you do not want\nto worry about wireless isolation that may be present on the\nnetwork to which you are connected.

After using ProGuard,\nthe resulting .apk is smaller and more difficult to reverse engineer.\nFor more information, see http://developer.android.com/guide/developing/tools/proguard.html.\n\n\nKnowing the names of methods, interfaces, annotations, and\nclasses is important for the AllJoyn framework to operate\nproperly. If the code is passed through ProGuard the names\nwill be changed, annotations will be removed and AllJoyn code\nwill no longer function as expected. To use ProGuard, the\nproguard.cfg file must have additional options added.\n\n\nBelow is a sample proguard.cfg file that would be needed if\nwe wanted to use ProGuard with the Android Chat sample.\nThe \nproguard.cfg\n is based on the default file created\nwhen using an Android project. In the sample \nproguard.cfg\n\nfile below, the text in the #REQUIRED FOR ALLJOYN TO FUNCTION\nsection is an example of what must be added.\n\n\nCode 52.

This is especially true when the contents of the\nsignal are really small.\n\n\nHeader compression can be used to improve performance.\nSince setting up header compression is an expensive operation,\nit should not be used except for repetitive signals.\n\n\nAn example would be a game that wants to constantly update\nits player's positions. The same signal would be repetitively\nsent with the new player position. Header compression could\nbe used to reduce the size of the signal.\n\n\nCode 53. Header compression\n\n\n// Create the signal emitter and connect it with the SampleInterface class\nSignalEmitter emitter = new SignalEmitter(mySignalInterface,\n   SignalEmitter.GlobalBroadcast.On);\nemitter.setCompressHeader(true);\n\n\n\n\nShutting off discovery\n\n\nWhen trying to transmit large amounts of data via Bluetooth,\ndiscovery can significantly slow down the transfer speed.\nIf the transmit time is a factor, it may be beneficial to stop\ndiscovery when sending the data.\n\n\nIt is good practice to shut off discovery when an interface\nhas been found even when using TCP/IP. Leaving discovery\nrunning could have an impact on battery life and network\nperformance since the routing node continues to access the\nradio to look for remote services.\n\n\nCode 54. Shutting off Discovery\n\n\nstatus = mBus.cancelFindName(SERVICE_NAME);\nif (status != Status.OK) {\n   finish();\n   return;\n}\n\n\n\n\nSignal emitters\n\n\nWhen setting up a SignalEmitter, you can set it up to broadcast:\n\n\n\n\nGlobally to clients only on the local device\n\n\nGlobally to all clients even off device\n\n\nTo a session\n\n\nTo a single destination\n\n\n\n\nAs a general rule, it is best to avoid signal emitters that\ndo not exist in the same session. This creates a large amount\nof network traffic. If you want the signal to be received by\nmultiple devices, it is best to set up a multipoint session\nand send the signal to all the devices in the session.\nThis reduces the network traffic by sending the signal to\ndestinations that have registered",

For more information see Android-Specific Considerations , or check out the samples found\nin the AllJoyn Android SDK.  Loading the native library  You must load the native system library into your code at runtime.\nTo do so, add the following lines to your code.  Code 1. Load native library  static {\n   System.loadLibrary( alljoyn_java );\n}  Creating an AllJoyn interface  The AllJoyn framework enables inter-process communication\nthrough an object. The object is defined as a bus interface.  Each interface can contain:   Methods  Signals  Properties   Code 2. Example of an interface  @BusInterface (name =  org.my.interface.name )\npublic interface MyInterface {\n\n   @BusMethod\n   public String MyMethod(String inStr) throws BusException;\n\n   @BusSignal\n   public void MySignal(String inStr) throws BusException;\n\n   @BusProperty\n   public String GetMyProperty() throws BusException;\n\n   @BusProperty\n   public void SetMyProperty(String myProperty) throws  BusException;\n\n}  Using @BusInterface annotation  The @BusInterface annotation tells the code that this\ninterface is an AllJoyn interface. All bus interfaces\nmust have a name. If you do not assign a name, a default\nname is assigned.  The default interface name is  . .  Generally, you should choose your interface name and not use\nthe default. Set the interface name by specifying the name\nannotation property.  Interface naming rules  from http://dbus.freedesktop.org/doc/dbus-specification.html.   Interfaces have names with type STRING, meaning that they\nmust be valid UTF-8 characters.  There are also some additional restrictions that apply\nto interface names, specifically:  Interface names are composed of one or more elements\n  separated by a period (\".\") character. All elements must\n  contain at least one character.  Each element must only contain the ASCII characters\n  [A-Z][a-z][0-9]_ and must not begin with a digit.  Interface names must contain at least one \".\" (period)\n  character (and thus at least two elements).  Interface names must not begin with a \".\" (period) character.  Interface names must not exceed the maximum name length of 255 characters.   Using @BusMethod annotation  The @BusMethod annotation tells the Java compiler that\nthis is a bus method. AllJoyn methods work almost identical\nto a regular method in Java. The major difference is that\nthe AllJoyn methods execute on a different process or device.\nThe method can accept multiple arguments and reply with\nmultiple arguments. AllJoyn methods can have multiple\nreturn values, but Java methods only allow a single return\nvalue. To receive multiple return values requires a container\nthat can hold the multiple return values. Multiple return values  explains how to do this.  The @BusMethod annotation has four properties: annotation, name,\nsignature, and replySignature.  Under normal circumstances, the values for the annotation\nproperties can be determined by the AllJoyn framework.\nHowever, there are instances in which the signature must\nbe specified; for example you need to send an unsigned integer\nin a method. Since Java does not have an unsigned integer type,\nthis must be specified in the @BusMethod annotation.  Code 3. Specifying signature and replySignature  @BusMethod(signature= u , replySignature= u )\npublic int MyMethod3(int unsignedArg) throws BusException;  The AllJoyn framework is very good at automatically assigning\na signature for the arguments specified in the method or signal.\nIf given the code shown in  Code 4. Auto assignment of signatures , note that the\nsignature and replySignature are not specified as part of\nthe @BusMethod annotation. The AllJoyn framework automatically\nassigns this method a signature \"sdib\" and a replySignature of\n\"i.\" The only time you must specify the signature is when it\ncannot be obtained from the interface itself.  Code 4. Auto assignment of signatures  @BusMethod\npublic int MyMethod4(String sArg,\n   double dArg,\n   int iArg,\n   boolean bArg) throws BusException;  The valid values for the signature and replySignature are any\nvalues that are valid according to http://dbus.freedesktop.org/doc/dbus-specification.html.  Using @BusSignal annotation  The @BusSignal annotation specifies that the following code\nis an AllJoyn signal. Unlike methods, signals have no replies.\nBecause of this, signals always have a return type of void.  Like methods, signals can take multiple arguments.  A signal is seen only if a program has registered a signal\nhandler for that signal. See  Using AllJoyn signals \nto register and use a signal handler.  Using @BusProperty annotation  The @BusProperty annotation specifies that the following code\nis an AllJoyn property. AllJoyn properties are exactly like\nAllJoyn methods except they are specialized for get/set\ncommands of a single value.  More complex AllJoyn interface concepts  Making a secure bus interface using the @Secure annotation  Indicating that an interface must use a secured authentication\nmechanism is as simple as adding the @Secure annotation to the interface.  Code 5. Creating a secure interface  @BusInterface(name =  org.sample.SecureInterface )\n@Secure\npublic interface SecureInterface {\n\n   @BusMethod\n   String myMethod(String inStr) throws BusException;\n}  The @Secure annotation informs the bus that no method call\nor signal can be sent without authentication.  The server must authenticate that the client is trusted\nusing one of the built-in authentication protocols.\nAfter authentication is completed, all messages and signals\nhave the body of the message encrypted. Only the authenticated\nclient can read the message. Only the body of the message is encrypted.\nThe header is left unencrypted and any bus can read the header\nand use it to forward the message to its destination.  The @Secure annotation has the property  value  [AllJoyn 3.4.0].\nThe 'value' property can have one of the following values:   required (default value) - Methods on the interface can\nonly be called by an authenticated peer.  off - Authentication is never required.  inherit - The object inherits the security of the objects\nthat implement the interface.  If an unknown value is specified the interface will default\nto inherit.   Normally,  value  will not need to be explicitly specified\nunless you want the value 'off' since using @Secure without\nspecifying a value is the same as specifying  @secure(value=\"required\") .\nInterfaces that omit the @Secure annotation is the same as\nspecifying  @Secure(value=\"inherit\") .  In general, unless you are sure your interface will never\nneed authentication, it is best to avoid using `@Secure(value=\"off\")\nin your interface specification.  For more information on the three built-in authentication\nmechanisms, see  AllJoyn authentication mechanisms .  Complex data types using the @Position annotation  Beyond simple data types, the AllJoyn framework can handle\ncomplex data types such as arrays, maps, and structs. In the case\nof arrays and maps, the data type can be handled by the AllJoyn code\nwith no special action. However, structs require additional annotation.  The AllJoyn framework must know the order of all elements of a\nstruct so that it can marshal and unmarshal (i.e., serialize)\nthe message. This is where the @Position annotation is used.  Say that you have a structure that holds information about\na photo; the code could look something like this:  Code 6. Example data structure using @Position annotation  public class ImageInfo{\n @Position(0)\n public String fileName;\n @Position(1)\n public int isoValue;\n @Position(2)\n public int dateTaken;\n}  The @Position annotation numbering must start from \"0\" (zero)\nand count up in increments of one. Skipping a number, like\ngoing from @Position(1) to @Position(3) without having an\n@Position(2) anywhere in the code, is a logic error.  The signature for all structures is \"r\" or the list of all\nthe values of the structure inside parentheses. For example,\nthe signature for the ImageInfo class would be \"(sii)\" in  Code 6. Example data structure using @Position annotation .  Multiple return values  If, for some reason, an interface with multiple return values\nis used, a container must be made to hold those values.\nIf you have a method called \"timer\" that returns a startTime\nand an endTime, an interface could be designed to handle\nthe two return values.  Code 7. Method that accepts multiple return values  @BusInterface (name =  org.my.timerInterface )\npublic interface MultipleReturnValuesInterface {\n\n   public class Values {\n      @Position(0) public int startTime;\n      @Position(1) public int endTime;\n   }\n\n   @BusMethod(replySignature= ii )\n\n   public Values timer() throws BusException;\n}  NOTE:  The replySignature has to be specified, or the AllJoyn framework\nassumes the replySignature is a struct with the replySignature \"(ii)\".  Parentheses indicate a struct, which is a single return value, while\nno parentheses indicate two separate return values.  Connecting to the AllJoyn router  When connecting with the bus, a program may act as a service,\na client, or both.  Connecting a service  Connecting a service consists of several steps.   Create a new BusAttachment.  Register a BusObject with a given absolute path using the BusAttachment.  Connect the BusAttachment to the bus.  Request a well-known name from the bus.   Code 8. Connecting a service to the bus (no error checking)  mBus = new BusAttachment( applicationName );\nmBus.registerBusObject(this,  /servicepath );\nmBus.connect();\nint flags = 0; //no request name flags\nmBus.requestName( com.my.well.known.name , flags);  This code does not have any error handling; thus, it is a\npoor programming example. It does show what the functions are doing.\nThe functions BusAttachment.registerBusObject(...),\nBusAttachment.connect(), and DBusProxyObj.RequestName(...) all\nreturn status that should be checked.  Code 9. Connecting a service (with error checking)  mBus = new BusAttachment( applicationName );\nStatus status = mBus.registerBusObject(this,  /servicepath );\nif (Status.OK != status) {\n   System.out.println( BusAttachment.registerBusObject() failed:   + status);\n\n   System.exit(0);\n   return;\n}\n\nstatus = mBus.connect();\n\nif (Status.OK != status) {\n   System.out.println( BusAttachment.connect() failed:   + status);\n   System.exit(0);\n   return;\n}\nint flags = 0; //no request name flags\nstatus = mBus.requestName( com.my.well.known.name , flags);\nif (status != Status.OK) {\n   System.out.println( BusAttachment.requestName failed:   + status);\n   System.exit(0);\n   return;\n}  NOTE:  This code would have to be in a class that implements the\nBusObject. If it did not implement the BusObject, the following\nline would not work:  mBus.registerBusObject(this,  /servicepath );  The flags value is a bit-mask that is used to tell the bus\nhow to respond if the well-known name requested already exists\non the bus. It also tells the bus how to act if the well-known name\nis already owned and another application requests the same well-known name.  The flag options are:   BusAttachment.ALLJOYN_REQUEST_NAME_ALLOW_REPLACEMENT  BusAttachment.ALLJOYN_REQUEST_NAME_REPLACE_EXISTING  BusAttachment.ALLJOYN_REQUEST_NAME_DO_NOT_QUEUE   AllJoyn request name flags     AllJoyn flag name  Value      ALLJOYN_REQUEST_NAME_ALLOW_REPLACEMENT  0x1    ALLJOYN_REQUEST_NAME_REPLACE_EXISTING  0x2    ALLJOYN_REQUEST_NAME_DO_NOT_QUEUE  0x4     Using the value of 0x0 (zero) for the AllJoyn flag is a\nvalid option. It means do not use any requestName flags.\nWhen using no flags to request a well-known name from\nthe bus, if the name already exists on the bus, your\nname request is added to the queue of other applications\nthat have also requested that name.  The BusAttachment.requestName returns one of the following status values:  Results from a RequestName call     DBusProxyObj.RequestName result  Value      OK  1    DBUS_REQUEST_NAME_REPLY_IN_QUEUE  2    DBUS_REQUEST_NAME_REPLY_EXISTS  3    DBUS_REQUEST_NAME_REPLY_ALREADY_OWNER  4    BUS_UNEXPECTED_DISPOSITION     BUS_NOT_CONNECTED      The valid flag combinations and RequestName results are\nall specified and described at http://dbus.freedesktop.org/doc/dbus-specification.html.  Connecting a client  To connect a client:   Create a BusAttachment.  Connect the BusAttachment to the bus.  Make a proxy object with the service name, absolute service path,\nand the interface of interest.  Make a proxy connection with the specified AllJoyn interface.  (Optional) Register signal handlers if the interface of interest\nhas any signals or if you are interested in any of the signals\nthat are part of the D-Bus or AllJoyn specification.   Code 10. Connecting a client (with error checking)  mBus = new BusAttachment( applicationName );\n\nStatus status = mBus.connect();\nif (Status.OK != status) {\n   System.out.println( BusAttachment.connect() failed:  + status));\n   System.exit(0);\n   return;\n}\n\nmProxyObj = mBus.getProxyBusObject( org.my.well.known.name ,\n    /servicepath ,\n   BusAttachment.SESSION_ID_ANY\n   new Class[] { MyInterface.class });\n\nmMyInterface = mProxyObj.getInterface(MyInterface.class);\n\nstatus = mBus.registerSignalHandlers(this);\nif (status != Status.OK) {\n   System.out.println( BusAttachment.registerSignalHandlers() failed:  +\nstatus));\n   System.exit(0);\n   return;\n}  mMyInterface can now be used to call methods found on the service.  The given well-known name and path can have multiple interfaces.\nWhen using  getProxyBusObject() , list all of the interfaces\nyou are interested in using. There could have been multiple\ninterfaces available at the object path \"/servicepath.\"\nIf there was a second interface called MySecondInterface and\nyou also wanted to make a proxy connection to that interface,\nthen you need to list both interfaces when calling  getProxyBusObject() .  When calling the  getInterface()  method, you are selecting\none of the possible interfaces out of the interfaces obtained\nfrom the  getProxyBusObject()  method call.  Code 11. Multiple interfaces  mProxyObj = mBus.getProxyBusObject( org.my.well.known.name ,\n    /servicepath ,\n   BusAttachment.SESSION_ID_ANY,\n   new Class[] { MyInterface.class, MySecondInterface.class });\n\nmMyInterface = mProxyObj.getInterface(MyInterface.class);\nmMySecondInterface = mProxyObj.getInterface(MySecondInterface.class);  Discovery and sessions  Full user control  What makes the AllJoyn framework exciting is the ability to\ndiscover remote buses and interact with the interfaces on\nthose remote buses as if they are local.  The AllJoyn router runs in the background. If an application\nasks the router to look for a remote interface, the router\ntries to locate the requested service. When the router is started,\nit is told which transport protocols to use (i.e., Bluetooth, TCP/IP).\nIf any device can make a connection using any of the available\ntransport protocols, its services can then be discovered and\nused by all of the devices that have been discovered in a\ndynamically-formed, peer-to-peer network.  Once the well-known name has been discovered, your application\ncan join a started communication session using a user-selected session port.  NOTE:  Valid SessionPort values range from 1 to 0xFFFF.  How discovery works  For a service and client to discover each other, they must agree upon three things:   A well-known bus name that will be advertised  The object path  The session port number that will be used   The discovery sequence follows.   To advertise a service, start with the procedure described in  Connecting a service .  Create a new BusAttachment with RemoteMessage.Receive.  Register your BusObject; the local implementation of your\n     interface with the BusAttachment.  Register a BusListener; a bus listener may not be needed,\n     depending on your application.  Connect the BusAttachment with the AllJoyn router.   Bind the session port.  As part of binding the session port, you also need to\n create a SessionPort Listener that is used to respond\n to JoinSession requests from the client.    Request a well-known name from the bus.   Advertise the same well-known name.  To connect to the advertised service:  Create a new BusAttachment with RemoteMessage.Receive.  Register a BusListener; in this case it is required\n     for the foundAdvertisedName signal.  Find the Advertised well-known name.  When the foundAdvertisedName signal is received, join the session.   IMPORTANT: Although you can advertise different names than your\nservice's well-known name, it would result in the bus not being\nable to use your service. It is an error to advertise a different name\nthan your service's own well-known name.  Sample code  Code 12. Obtaining a well-known name/advertising the well-known name  BusAttachment mBus;\nmBus = new BusAttachment(getClass().getName(),\nBusAttachment.RemoteMessage.Receive);\n\nStatus status = mBus.registerBusObject(myBusObject,  /MyService );\nif (status != Status.OK) {\n   System.exit(0);\n   return;\n}\n\nstatus = mBus.connect();\n\nif (status != Status.OK) {\n   System.exit(0);\n   return;\n}\n\nprivate static final short CONTACT_PORT=42;\nMutable.ShortValue contactPort = new Mutable.ShortValue(CONTACT_PORT);\nSessionOpts sessionOpts = new SessionOpts();\nsessionOpts.traffic = SessionOpts.TRAFFIC_MESSAGES;\nsessionOpts.isMultipoint = false; sessionOpts.proximity = SessionOpts.PROXIMITY_ANY;\nsessionOpts.transports = SessionOpts.TRANSPORT_ANY;\n\nstatus = mBus.bindSessionPort(contactPort, sessionOpts,\nnew SessionPortListener() {\n@Override\npublic boolean acceptSessionJoiner(short sessionPort,\nString joiner, SessionOpts sessionOpts) {\nif (sessionPort == CONTACT_PORT) {\nreturn true;\n} else {\nreturn false;\n}\n}\n});\n\nInt flags = 0; //do not use any request name flags\nstatus = mBus.requestName( com.my.well.known.name , flags);\nif (status != Status.OK) {\n   System.exit(0);\n   return;\n}\n\n/*\n * Important: the well-known name advertised should be identical\n * to the well-known name requested from the bus. Using a\n * different name is a logic error.\n */\nstatus = mBus.advertiseName( com.my.well.known.name ,\n   SessionOpts.TRANSPORT_ANY);\nif (status != Status.OK) {\n   /*\n    * If we are unable to advertise the name, release\n    * the well-known name from the local bus.\n    */\n   mBus.releaseName( com.my.well.know.name );\n   System.exit(0);\n   return;\n}\n\nif (status != Status.OK) {\nSystem.exit(0);\nreturn;\n}  Code 13. Find well-known name and join session  BusAttachment mBus;\nmBus = new BusAttachment(getClass().getName(),\nBusAttachment.RemoteMessage.Receive);\nprivate static final short CONTACT_PORT=42;\n\nmBus.registerBusListener(new BusListener() {\n@Override\npublic void foundAdvertisedName(String name,\n  short transport,\n  String namePrefix) {\n  mBus.enableConcurrentCallbacks();\n  short contactPort = CONTACT_PORT;\n  SessionOpts sessionOpts = new SessionOpts();\n  Mutable.IntegerValue sessionId = new Mutable.IntegerValue();\n\n  Status status = mBus.joinSession((String) msg.obj,\ncontactPort,\nsessionId, sessionOpts,\nnew SessionListener());}\n});\n\nStatus status = mBus.connect();\nif (status != Status.OK) {\n   System.exit(0);\n   return;\n}\n\nstatus = mBus.findAdvertisedName( com.my.well.known.name );\nif (status != Status.OK) {\n   System.exit(0);\n   return;\n}  Using AllJoyn methods  So far, we have talked about making an interface and\nwe have talked about how to connect to the bus and discover\na remote bus using sessions. This section shows how to write\nan AllJoyn bus method that can be instantiated from a remote process.  Suppose you have the following interface:  Code 14. Sample interface with AllJoyn methods  @BusInterface (name =  org.sample.busMethods )\npublic interface SampleInterface {\n\n   @BusMethod\n   public String Ping(String str) throws BusException;\n\n   @BusMethod\n   public String Concatenate(String arg1, String arg2) throws BusException;\n\n   @BusMethod\n   public int Fibonacci(int arg1) throws BusException;\n}  Code 15. Implementing the SampleInterface in the Service  class SampleService implements SampleInterface, BusObject {\n   public String Ping(String str){\n      return str;\n   }\n\n   public String Concatenate(String arg1, String arg2){\n      return arg1+arg2;\n   }\n\n   public int Fibonacci(int arg1){\n      int a=0,b=1;\n\n   for (int i=0;i arg1;i++){\n      a=a+b;\n      b=a-b;\n   }\n   return a;\n\n   }\n}  Now that the SampleInterface has an implementation, you must\nuse a SampleService object when you are registering the bus object.  Code 16. Connecting the bus using the SampleService BusObject  SampleService mySampleService;\nBusAttachment mBus;\nmBus = new BusAttachment(getClass().getName(),\nBusAttachment.RemoteMessage.Receive);\n\n/*\n * This line of code makes the local interface available to the bus\n */\nStatus status = mBus.registerBusObject(mySampleService,  /MyService );\nif (status != Status.OK) {\n   System.exit(0);\n   return;\n}\n\nstatus = mBus.connect();\nif (status != Status.OK) {\n   System.exit(0);\n   return;\n}\n\nprivate static final short CONTACT_PORT=42;\nMutable.ShortValue contactPort = new Mutable.ShortValue(CONTACT_PORT);\nSessionOpts sessionOpts = new SessionOpts();\nsessionOpts.traffic = SessionOpts.TRAFFIC_MESSAGES;\nsessionOpts.isMultipoint = false;\nsessionOpts.proximity = SessionOpts.PROXIMITY_ANY;\nsessionOpts.transports = SessionOpts.TRANSPORT_ANY;\n\nstatus = mBus.bindSessionPort(contactPort, sessionOpts,\nnew SessionPortListener() {\n@Override\npublic boolean acceptSessionJoiner(short sessionPort,\nString joiner,\nSessionOpts sessionOpts) {\nif (sessionPort == CONTACT_PORT) {\nreturn true;\n} else {\nreturn false;\n}\n\n}\n});\nif (status != Status.OK) { System.exit(0);\nreturn;\n\n}\nInt flags = 0; //do not use any request name flags\nstatus = mBus.requestName( com.my.well.known.name , flags);\nif (status != Status.OK) {\n   System.exit(0);\n   return;\n}\n\nstatus = mBus.advertiseName( com.my.well.known.name , SessionOpts.TRANSPORT_ANY);\nif (status != Status.OK) {\n   mBus.releaseName( com.my.well.know.name );\n   System.exit(0);\n   return;\n}  Code 17. Calling a remote method from the SampleInterface  private BusAttachment mBus;\nmBus = new BusAttachment(getClass().getName(),\nBusAttachment.RemoteMessage.Receive);\n\nStatus status = mBus.connect();\nif (Status.OK != status) {\n   System.exit(0);\n   return;\n}\n\nprivate ProxyBusObject mProxyObj;\nprivate SampleInterface mSampleInterface;\n\nprivate static final short CONTACT_PORT=42;\n\nmBus.registerBusListener(new BusListener() {\n@Override\npublic void foundAdvertisedName(String name,\n   short transport,\n   String namePrefix) {\n      mBus.enableConcurrentCallbacks();\n      short contactPort = CONTACT_PORT;\n      SessionOpts sessionOpts = new SessionOpts();\n      sessionOpts.traffic = SessionOpts.TRAFFIC_MESSAGES;\n         sessionOpts.isMultipoint = false;\n         sessionOpts.proximity = SessionOpts.PROXIMITY_ANY;\n      sessionOpts.transports = SessionOpts.TRANSPORT_ANY;\n\n      Mutable.IntegerValue sessionId = new Mutable.IntegerValue();\n\n      Status status = mBus.joinSession(name,\ncontactPort,\nsessionId,\nsessionOpts,\nnew SessionListener());\n\n   mProxyObj = mBus.getProxyBusObject( com.my.well.known.name ,\n       /MyService ,\n         sessionId.value,\n            new Class[] { SampleInterface.class });\n   mSampleInterface = mProxyObj.getInterface(SampleInterface.class);\n});\n\nStatus status = mBus.connect();\nif (status != Status.OK) {\n   System.exit(0);\n   return;\n}\n\nstatus = mBus.findAdvertisedName( com.my.well.known.name );\nif (status != Status.OK) {\n   System.exit(0);\n   return;\n}  Now that you have a proxy connection to the remote service\nthrough mSampleInterface, you can just call it like you would\nif the code were implemented locally.  Code 18. Calling the remote methods  try {\n   // will return  Hello World \n   String strPing = mSampleInterface.Ping( Hello World );\n   // will return  The Eagle has landed! \n   String strCat = mSampleInterface.Concatenate( The Eagle  ,  has landed! );\n\n   // will return 3\n   int fib = mSampleInterface.Fibonacci(4);\n} catch (BusException e) {\n   //Handle exception here.\n}  Not all methods need to return a value and not all methods need input arguments.  NOTE:  Remote methods cannot be called until we have obtained\nan interface object from the ProxyBusObject class. Trying to\ncall a remote method before obtaining the interface could result\nin your application crashing. The mSampleInterface is a null object\nuntil we have connected it to the service using the ProxyBusObject.getInterface()  method.  Using AllJoyn signals  Signals, unlike methods, never return a value. Client applications\nthat are interested in receiving a signal must register for that\nsignal with the bus. The client must implement a signal handler to\nrespond to the signal for which it has registered.  Code 19. Example interface containing signals  @BusInterface (name =  org.sample.busSignals )\npublic interface SampleInterface {\n\n   @BusSignal\n   public void buttonClicked(int id) throws BusException;\n\n   @BusSignal\n   public void playerPosition(int x, int y, int z) throws BusException;\n}  Code 20. Create an empty class implementation  class SignalInterface implements SampleInterface, BusObject {\n   public void buttonClicked(int id) {/*No code needed here*/}\n   public void playerPosition(int x, int y, int z){/*No code needed here*/}\n}  A SignalEmitter is required to emit a signal. To create a SignalEmitter,\nyou must have a BusObject. The code above creates a BusObject that\nis aware of the bus signals found in the SampleInterface. Signals do not\nneed to have any code added to transmit a signal, you just inform the\nbus that a signal with a given interface exists.  Once a SignalEmitter is created, an interface can be made to\nsend the actual signals. No coding is needed to emit the signals\nbeyond defining and using the interface.  Code 21. Connect signals to the bus and emitting the signals - service  private static final short CONTACT_PORT=42;\nstatic int sessionId;\nstatic String joinerName;\n\nboolean sessionEstablished = false;\n\nBusAttachment mBus;\nmBus = new BusAttachment( AppName , BusAttachment.RemoteMessage.Receive);\nSignalInterface mySignalInterface = new SignalInterface();\n\nStatus status = mBus.registerBusObject(mySignalInterface,  /MyService/Path );\nif (status != Status.OK) {\n   System.exit(0);\n   return;\n}\n\nstatus = mBus.connect();\nif (status != Status.OK) {\n   System.exit(0);\n   return;\n}\n\nint flags = 0; //do not use any request name flags\nstatus = mBus.requestName( com.my.well.known.name , flags);\nif (status != Status.OK) { System.exit(0);\nreturn;\n}\n\nstatus = mBus.advertiseName( com.my.well.known.name ,\n   SessionOpts.TRANSPORT_ANY);\nif (status != Status.OK) {\n   System.out.println( Status =   + status);\n   mBus.releaseName( com.my.well.known.name );\n   System.exit(0);\n   return;\n}\n\nMutable.ShortValue contactPort = new Mutable.ShortValue(CONTACT_PORT);\nSessionOpts sessionOpts = new SessionOpts();\nsessionOpts.traffic = SessionOpts.TRAFFIC_MESSAGES;\nsessionOpts.isMultipoint = false;\nsessionOpts.proximity = SessionOpts.PROXIMITY_ANY;\nsessionOpts.transports = SessionOpts.TRANSPORT_ANY;\n\nstatus = mBus.bindSessionPort(contactPort, sessionOpts,\n   new SessionPortListener() {\n   public boolean acceptSessionJoiner(short sessionPort, String joiner,\n      SessionOpts sessionOpts) {\n   if (sessionPort == CONTACT_PORT) {\n   return true;\n   } else {\n   return false;\n   }\n\n   }\n   public void sessionJoined(short sessionPort, int id, String joiner) {\n      sessionId = id; joinerName = joiner; sessionEstablished = true;\n   }\n});\n\ntry {\nwhile (!sessionEstablished) {\n   Thread.sleep(10);\n}\n\nSignalEmitter emitter = new SignalEmitter(mySignalInterface, joinerName,\n   sessionId,\nSignalEmitter.GlobalBroadcast.Off);\nmyInterface = emitter.getInterface(SampleInterface.class);\n// Emitting signals myInterface.buttonClicked(1);\nmyInterface.playerPosition(12, 1, -24);\n\n} catch (InterruptedException ex) {\n  System.out.println( Interrupted );\n} catch (BusException ex) {\nSystem.out.println( Bus Exception:   + ex.toString());\n}  Code 22. Registering signal handlers - client  status = mBus.registerSignalHandlers(this);\nif (status != Status.OK) {\n   System.exit(0);\n   return;\n}  When registering for signal handlers, you must implement a\nclass that contains a method with the @BusSignalHandler annotation.\nIn  Code 22. Registering signal handlers - client , the signal\nhandler would need to be in the same class. If needed, a\ndifferent class can be used to handle the signals; just\nput that class as an argument for the registerSignalHandlers method.  Code 23. Adding signal handlers - client  @BusSignalHandler(iface= org.sample.busSignals , signal= buttonClicked )\npublic void buttonClicked(int id) {\n   switch(id)\n   case 0:\n      startNewGame();\n      break;\n   case 1:\n\n      continueGame();\n      break;\n   case 2:\n      quitGame();\n      break;\n   default:\n      break;\n}\n\n@BusSignalHandler(iface= org.sample.busSignals , signal= playerPosition )\npublic void playerPosition(int x, int y, int z) {\nupdatePlayerPosition(x,y,z);\n}  The important part of the BusSignalHandler is to get the\niface name and the signal arguments correct. If these are not\ncorrect, it does not catch the emitted signal. The function name\nitself is not important; it could be changed from public void buttonClicked(int id)  to  public void foo(int id) \nand it would still catch the \"buttonClicked\" signal.  Sessionless signals  A signal is a way to send one-way acknowledgment data from\none peer to another or to multiple peers. However, when sending\na signal we typically need to be a part of a session.\nThere are many use cases where using a session to send a signal\nwould be unnecessary overhead. For example, when you want to\ninform a peer, who is not in session with you, of a changed state\nof information. This works two ways, with a peer specifying\nwhether he wants to receive such notifications and with the\npeer who is sending out this notification to anyone who subscribed for it.  It should be noted that there are performance limitations that need to be understood:   A sessionless signal is not a replacement for using a session,\nit is a shortcut to help avoid logic of setting up a session to\ntransmit small amounts of data.  Each sessionless signal will replace the previous one.\nIf the receiving side has not had a chance to pull the data,\nit will be lost and not transmitted to the other side.  Per number 2, the design of a sessionless signal is not\nto be used for File Transfer or frequent game play updates.\nThe design is for static information such as device details,\na player profile, or informing another application to invite\nto a session or trigger an action.  All sessionless signals have an overhead of creating and\ntearing down a connection which can cause unnecessary network\nchatter if used improperly for sending frequent data.   The way to send sessionless signals is not much different\nthan sending a regular signal. Just set the flag specifying\nthat it is a sessionless signal and set the session id used\nto send the signal to 0 since we are not a part of a session\nwhen we send this out.  A sessionless signal does not need a session id - thus the name.\nThe sample showing this simple feature is under  SDK/java/samples/sessionless .  Along the lines of the above-mentioned sample, let us assume\nthat a client peer is sending out sessionless signals. A service peer\nis the one that has subscribed for these signals/notifications.  Two things to know in the case of a sessionless signal is that:   It has a session id of 0.  It has the sessionless flag set to indicate that it is a\nsessionless signal.   This case can look like the following:  SignalEmitter emitter = new SignalEmitter(mySignalService, 0,\nSignal.GlobalBroadcast.Off);\nemitter.setSessionlessFlag(true);  The service side, which wants to receive these sessionless signals,\ncalls an  addMatch()  function and passes in the rule for\nsessionless signals. This looks like (where \"my.signal.Service\"\nbelow is the name of the interface emitting the sessionless signal):  Status status = mBus.addMatch( interface=;my.signal.Service',sessionless='t' );  That is all we need. The service side would have the signal handler\nfor the signal sent by the client. No advertisements, no binding,\nor joining of sessions is necessary by any side.  Using AllJoyn properties  AllJoyn properties may be viewed as a specialized case of AllJoyn methods.\nAn AllJoyn property must start with the word \"get\" or \"set\".\nIf it starts with the word \"get\", it must return a single value\nand take no arguments. If it starts with the word \"set\",\nit must take a single parameter and return void. The parameter\ncan be a complex data type like an array or a structure.\nThis code should closely resemble the code used for AllJoyn methods.  Code 24. Interface using properties  @BusInterface (name =  org.samples.properties )\npublic interface PropertiesInterface {\n   @BusProperty\n   public int getTextSize() throws BusException;\n   @BusProperty\n   public void setTextSize(int size) throws BusException;\n}  Code 25. Implementation of the PropertiesInterface - service  class AllJoynProperties implements PropertiesInterface, BusObject {\n   private int mTextSize;\n\n   public int getTextSize() {\n      return mTextSize;\n   }\n\n   public void setTextSize(int size) {\n      mTextSize = size;\n   }\n}  Code 26. Connecting the Properties interface to the bus - service  private BusAttachment mBus;\nmBus = new BusAttachment(getClass().getName(),\nBusAttachment.RemoteMessage.Receive);\n\nAllJoynProperties mProperties = new AllJoynProperties();\nStatus status = mBus.registerBusObject(mProperties,  /testProperties );\nif (status != Status.OK) {\n   System.exit(0);\n   return;\n}  The D-Bus standard provides a way to get all of the properties\nfrom an interface. The code below shows how to use the interface\nimplemented in  Code 25. Implementation of the PropertiesInterface - service ,\nas well as the  GetAll method  from the D-Bus standard to\nget the  TextSize  property.  NOTE:  The GetAll method can return multiple values into a Map.\nEach property can be accessed using the name of the property.  Code 27. Calling the properties interface and using the GetAll method for properties  private BusAttachment mBus;\nprivate ProxyBusObject mProxyObj;\nprivate PropertiesInterface mPropertiesInterface;\nprivate Properties mProperties;\nprivate static short CONTACT_PORT = 42;\n\nprivate boolean isJoined = false;\n\nmBus = new BusAttachment(getClass().getName(),\nBusAttachment.RemoteMessage.Receive);\n\nmBus.registerBusListener(new BusListener {\n   public void foundAdvertisedName(String name, short transport,\nString namePrefix) {\n\n   short contactPort = CONTACT_PORT;\n   SessionOpts sessionOpts = new SessionOpts();\n   sessionOpts.traffic = SessionOpts.TRAFFIC_MESSAGES;\n   sessionOpts.isMultipoint = false;\n   sessionOpts.proximity = SessionOpts.PROXIMITY_ANY;\n   sessionOpts.transports = SessionOpts.TRANSPORT_ANY;\n\n   Mutable.IntegerValue sessionId = new Mutable.IntegerValue();\n\n   Status status = mBus.joinSession(name, contactPort, sessionId, sessionOpts,\nnew SessionListener());\n   if (status != Status.OK) {\n   System.exit(0);\n   }\n   mProxyObj =  mBus.getProxyBusObject( com.my.well.known.name ,\n       /testProperties ,\n      sessionId.value,\n      new Class ? [] { PropertiesInterface.class,\n         Properties.class });\n\n   mPropertiesInterface = mProxyObj.getInterface(PropertiesInterface.class);\n   mProperties = mProxyObj.getInterface({Properties.class);\n   isJoined = true;\n}\n});\nStatus status = mBus.connect();\nif (Status.OK != status) {\n   System.exit(0);\n   return;\n}\n\nstatus = mBus.findAdvertisedName( com.my.well.known.name );\nif (status != Status.OK) {\n   System.exit(0);\n}\n\nwhile(!isJoined) {\n   try { Thread.sleep(10);\n   } catch (InterruptedException e) {\n   System.out.println( Program interupted );\n   }\n}\n\nmPropertiesInterface.setTextSize(18);\nint textSize = mPropertiesInterface.getTextSize();\n\nMap String, Variant  map = mProperties.GetAll( org.samples.properties );\ntextSize = map.get( TextSize ).getObject(Integer.class);  Security  When an interface is marked as \"secure\", it indicates that all\ndata sent via a method call or signal must be encrypted.\nOnly an authenticated client can use an interface that has\nbeen marked as secure by using the @Secure annotation\n(see [Making a secure bus interface using the @Secure annotation][make-secure-bus-interface-using-secure-annotation]).  Marking an interface as a secure interface is as simple as\nadding the annotation @Secure when declaring the interface.\nSee  Code 5. Creating a secure interface .  It possible to use security and authentication with interfaces\nthat do not have the @Secure annotation. This is possible using Object Security.  Object security  Object Security allows you to force peer authentication\neven when the interface does not have the @Secure annotation.\nIt's possible to tell the AllJoyn framework that you want\nauthentication when you register a your BusObject.  Code 28. Registering an BusObject using Object Security  bus.registerBusObject(myService,  /my/object/path , true);  The ProxyBusObject should also indicate that it is using peer authentication.  Code 29. Get a ProxyBusObject that uses Object Security  bus.getProxyBusObject( my.wellknown.name ,  /my/object/path ,\nsessionId, new Class ? [] {MyInterface.class}, true);  For both the  registerBusObject  and  getProxyBusObject  methods,\nan extra Boolean argument can be added to the method calls.\nIf this is 'true', then peer authentication is used.  The programmer is responsible for making sure that both the\nBusObject and ProxyBusObject are using Object security. .\nIf the BusObject is created as a secure object, the ProxyBusObject\nshould also be secure. If they do not agree, it is an error.  AllJoyn authentication mechanisms  When using a secure interface, an authentication listener\nmust be created to handle authentication events. The authentication\nlistener provides authentication credentials for the local application\nand, depending on the authentication mechanism, checks the credential\nof the remote application.  The AllJoyn framework supports the following types of authentication mechanisms:   Secure Remote Password (SRP) anonymous key exchange  Secure Remote Password (SRP) logon (username and password)  RSA key exchange using X509 certificates  PIN key exchange  ECDHE_NULL key exchange  ECDHE_PSK key exchange  ECDHE_ECDSA key exchange   SRP key exchange uses a one-time authenticating password to\nset up an authentication key. This key is used for all subsequent\ninteractions between the client and server.  SRP logon requires that the user give a username and password\nbefore the client and server are able to share an interface,\nunlike the SRP key exchange where the password exchange is a\none-time event. SRP logon requires the username and password\nbe supplied each time a session is established between the\nclient and server.  RSA key exchange uses RSA public key cryptography to establish\na shared-secret passphrase. The shared-secret passphrase is\nused to establish a key. This key is then used for all subsequent\nexchanges between the given client and server using the protocol.  PIN key exchange uses a one-time authenticating password to\nset up an authentication key. This key is used for all subsequent\ninteractions between the client and server. PIN key exchange\nis specifically designed for devices that have really stringent\nmemory constrains like MCUs (Micro Control Units). Unless you are\ncommunicating with an MCU, it is recommended that you use an\nauthentication mechanism other than PIN key exchange.  ECDHE_NULL is an Elliptic Curve Diffie-Hellman Ephemeral key\nexchange which is anonymous.  ECDHE_PSK is an Elliptic Curve Diffie-Hellman Ephemeral key\nexchange which uses a pre-shared key like a PIN, a passphrase,\nor a symmetric key.  ECDHE_ECDSA is an Elliptic Curve Diffie-Hellman Ephemeral key\nexchange which uses a key agreement authenticated with an\nasymmetric key, and validated with an Elliptic Curve Digital\nSignature Algorithm (ECDSA) signature.  Each type of security mechanism requires that an Authentication\nListener be created that handles the specific type of security\nexchange needed. When creating the Authentication Listener, you\nspecify which type of authentication mechanism you want to use.\nEach authentication mechanism is specified by a string.  Authentication mechanisms and AllJoyn identifying string     Authentication mechanism  String identifying the authentication mechanism      SRP anonymous key exchange  ALLJOYN_SRP_KEYX    SRP logon  ALLJOYN_SRP_LOGON    RSA key exchange  ALLJOYN_RSA_KEYX    PIN key exchange ALLJOYN_PIN_KEYX     ECDHE_NULL key exchange  ALLJOYN_ECDHE_NULL    ECDHE_PSK key exchange  ALLJOYN_ECDHE_PSK    ECDHE_ECDSA key exchange  ALLJOYN_ECDHE_ECDSA     The AuthListener  The main difference between a secure application and a\nplain application, besides the @Secure annotation of the\ninterfaces, is the required inclusion of an AuthListener.\nAn implementation of an AuthListener contains two callback methods:   Requested  Completed   Any time a method call comes in on a secure interface,\nthe AllJoyn framework checks to see if it already knows how\nto decrypt the contents of the method call. If it cannot decrypt\nthe method call, the  requested(...)  method call is called.  The requested method call contains some or all of the following information:   The Authentication mechanism specified using one of the strings from Authentication mechanisms and AllJoyn identifying string .  PeerName - the well-known-name or unique name of the peer that initiated the\nAuthentication request.  A count of the number of authentication request attempts made.\n  The count for the first Authentication request starts at 1.  The user name of the user making the authentication request.\n  A user name is not required for all forms of authentications\n  and may be an empty string.  The specific type of authentication information being requested.\n  Depending on what type of authentication mechanism is being used,\n  one or more of these requests may be made:  CertificateRequest (RSA key exchange or ECDHE_ECDSA key exchange)  LogonEntryRequest (SRP logon)  PasswordRequest (SRP key exchange, SRP logon, RSA key exchange,\n    PIN key exchange, or ECDHE_PSK key exchange)  PrivateKeyRequest (RSA key exchange or ECDHE_ECDSA key exchange)  UserNameRequest (SRP logon)  VerifyRequest (RSA key exchange or ECDHE_ECDSA key exchange)   The  requested(...)  callback method may be called one or\nmore times for each authentication request. For each request,\nthe program is expected to obtain or generate the required\ninformation. The requested information can be obtained from any\nsource available including requesting information from a user.\nIf the requested information cannot be provided then returning\nfalse indicates failure.  Once the authentication has finished the  completed(...) \ncallback method is called. This contains:   The authentication mechanism that was just completed  The peerName (well-known name or unique name)  A boolean variable indicating if the authentication attempt completed successfully.   As we talk about each authentication method, message sequence\ncharts are provided showing method calls and callbacks used\nto set up the authenticated session. A legend for the\nMessage Sequence Chart (MSC) is provided in the following figure.   Figure: Message Sequence Chart legend  The message sequence charts simplify all device-to-device\ncommunication by ignoring bus traffic. All AllJoyn bus traffic\nis compressed into a single line in the message sequence charts\nlabeled \"AllJoyn Bus.\" This shows only the callbacks and\nmethod calls that we should be interested in when setting up authentication.  Code for SRP key exchange  SRP key exchange works similarly to pairing Bluetooth devices.\nThe devices advertise that they want to talk with one another\nand when they discover one another a password is entered on\nthe device. This one-time password proves that the device knows\nabout the Bluetooth device. Once this one-time pairing is completed,\nthe Bluetooth device can connect with the device at any time\nwithout repeating the pairing process.  Code 30. Registering the authentication listener \nsets up a client/server that uses SRP key exchange to set up\na secure connection. The code shares many similarities with\npairing a Bluetooth device.   There is a one-time password exchange.  Once the authentication is completed the client and server\ncan communicate without asking for passwords to be entered.  Even after the program is closed and restarted, the\nauthentication is still valid.   The following figure shows the sequence in which the callback\nmethods are instantiated the first time a secure method call\nis made using SRP key exchange. The sequence shown only happens\nthe first time the sender tries to communicate with the receiver.   Figure: MSC SRP key exchange  In  Code 30. Registering the authentication listener ,\nthe sender is the client and the receiver is the service.  Before calling connect, the  BusAttachment.registerAuthListener() \nshould be called. The code snippet below shows registering an\nAuthListener with the name SrpKeyXListener. The code for the\nSrpKeyXListener is shown in  Code 31. SRP key exchange AuthListener - service \nfor the service and  Code 32. SRP key exchange AuthListener - client  for the client.  Code 30. Registering the authentication listener  BusAttachment mBus;\nmBus = new BusAttachment( myProgramName , BusAttachment.RemoteMessage.Receive);\n\nSrpKeyXListener myAuthListener;\n\nStatus status = mBus.registerAuthListener( ALLJOYN_SRP_KEYX ,\n   myAuthListener);\nif (status != Status.OK) {\n   finish();\n   return;\n}  The rest of the steps for connecting and advertising the\nservice have been covered in  Discovery and sessions \nand are unchanged for a secure interface.  When registering the AuthListener, we have identified what\ntype of security the AuthListener is responsible for handling - in this case, \"ALLJOYN_SRP_KEYX\" .  Code 31. SRP key exchange AuthListener - service  /*\n* This Secure Remote Password Key Exchange listener creates a random\n* 6-digit pin code for each authentication attempt.\n*/\nprivate static class SrpKeyXListener implements AuthListener {\n   private Random mPasswordGenerator;\n   private boolean mGeneratePassword;\n\n   public SrpKeyXListener() {\n      mPasswordGenerator = new Random();\n      mGeneratePassword = true;\n   }\n\n   @Override\n   public boolean requested(String mechanism, String peerName, int count,\n      String userName, AuthRequest[] requests) {\n      if (mGeneratePassword) {\n         mGeneratePassword = false;\n      mPassword = String.format( %06d ,\nmPasswordGenerator.nextInt(1000000));\n      System.out.println( One Time Password :   + mPassword);\n      }\n      for (AuthRequest request : requests) {\n         if (request instanceof PasswordRequest) {\n            ((PasswordRequest) request).setPassword(mPassword.toCharArray());\n\n         }\n      }\n      return true;\n   }\n\n   @Override\n   public void completed(String mechanism, String peerName,\nboolean authenticated) {\n      mGeneratePassword = true;\n   }\n}  The first time that the requested callback is called,\na six-digit random number is generated and set as the password.\nWe check to see what  instanceof  AuthRequest we received.\nSince we are using SRP key exchange, we are only expecting\npassword requests. We cast the base AuthRequest type to a PasswordRequest  and call the  setPassword  method passing in a\nCharArray of the six-digit random number that was generated.\nThe code shown does not limit the number of times an application\ncan try to authenticate with this code. We can see the number\nof times the user has tried to authenticate by looking at the\ncount parameter. This code only generates a new PIN code\nat the start of an authentication attempt; as long as  completed \nhas not been called, the same password is used.  Code 32. SRP key exchange AuthListener - client  /*\n* This Secure Remote Password Key eXchange listener will ask the user to\n* enter the one time password.  This password must match the six-digit\n* string randomly generated by the service's SrpKeyXListener class.\n*\n* The following code limits the user to three authentication attempts.\n*/\nstatic class SrpKeyXListener implements AuthListener {\n   public boolean requested(String authMechanism,\nString authPeer, int count, String userName,\n         AuthRequest[] requests) {\n      if (count  = 3) {\n         System.out.println( Please enter one time password: );\n         Scanner in = new Scanner(System.in);\n         mPassword = in.nextLine();\n         for (AuthRequest request : requests) {\n            if (request instanceof PasswordRequest) {\n               ((PasswordRequest)\nrequest).setPassword(mPassword.toCharArray());\n            }\n         }\n         return true;\n      }\n      return false;\n   }\n\n   public void completed(String authMechanism, String authPeer, boolean\nauthenticated) {\n      if (!authenticated) {\n         System.out.println( Authentication failed. );\n      }\n   }\n}  Each time that the  requested  callback is called, the user\nis asked to provide the one-time password. The one-time password\nentered by the user must match the six-digit PIN code that was\nrandomly generated by the service. The user is given three attempts\nto provide the proper PIN code. If the user is unable to provide\nthe PIN code, the authentication attempt fails. Just like the code\nused in the service's SrpKeyXListener, we also check to see what instanceof  AuthRequest we have received. Since we are using\nSRP key exchange, we are only expecting password requests.\nThe base  AuthRequest  type is cast to a  PasswordRequest \ntype and the password is set using the  setPassword  method.\nUnlike the service, this code limits the number of attempts\nthe user is given to produce the proper PIN code. After three\nfailed attempts, this returns false indicating failure to\ncomplete authentication.  Code for SRP logon  SRP logon uses the familiar user name/password method for\nidentity verification. This should be familiar to anyone\nwho has used online shopping, email, or banking.  Unlike SRP key exchange and RSA key exchange, SRP logon requires\nthe user to enter the user name/password every time a session\nis established. The verification only lasts for the length of\nthe session. If the program is shut down and then restarted,\nthe user is asked to re-authenticate.   Figure: MSC SRP logon option 1   Figure: MSC SRP logon option 2   Figure: MSC SRP logon option 3   Figure: MSC SRP logon option 4  With SRP logon, there are four possible sequence diagrams.\nWhen the sender is requested to provide a user name or password,\nthey can provide just the user name or both the user name and password.\nThe information is sent to the receiver and the receiver then\nuses the user name to look up the password or logon. If the password\nwas also supplied and matches the receiver's password or the\ncomputer logon, the authentication completes. If only the\nuser name was supplied, the receiver then requests the user name\nand password from the sender.  What is the logon? The logon is a string that is computed\nusing the process described in  RFC 5054 .\nThis ends up being a large string that takes the form of  N:g:s:v  where:   N is a large prime number  g is the generator  s is the salt  v is the computed verifier   The logon gives all the information needed to compute the\nverifier from the user name and password. This is a strongly\nencrypted string that can be used to verify a user name and\npassword but cannot be used to obtain the user name and password.\nBecause it is a secure way to store a user name and password,\nmany databases do not actually store the password but instead\nstore the logon as defined by  RFC 5054 .\nComputing the logon string is beyond the scope of this document. Code 33. Registering the authentication listener for SRP logon \nuses plain text user name and password.  When using a secure interface, an authentication listener\nmust be created that handles authentication. The authentication\nlistener decides if the connecting client is a trusted client\nand if they should be allowed to use the interface. The implementation\nof the SrpLogonListener is shown in Code 33. Registering the authentication listener for SRP logon .\nSee  Code 34. SRP Logon AuthListener - service \nfor the service (receiver) and  Code 34. SRP Logon AuthListener - service \nfor the client (sender).  Code 33. Registering the authentication listener for SRP logon  BusAttachment mBus;\nmBus = new BusAttachment( myProgramName , BusAttachment.RemoteMessage.Receive);\n\nSrpLogonListener myAuthListener;\n\nStatus status = mBus.registerAuthListener( ALLJOYN_SRP_LOGON , myAuthListener);\n\nif (status != Status.OK) {\n   finish();\n   return;\n}  The rest of the steps for connecting and advertising the service\nhave been covered in the earlier sections and are unchanged\nfor a secure interface.  Code 34. SRP Logon AuthListener - service  class SrpLogonListener implements AuthListener {\n   private Map String, char[]  mUserNamePassword;\n\n   /* Populate the user name and password table used by this listener. */\n   public SrpLogonListener() {\n      mUserNamePassword = new HashMap String, char[] ();\n      mUserNamePassword.put( user1 ,  password1 .toCharArray());\n      mUserNamePassword.put( user2 ,  password2 .toCharArray());\n   }\n\n   /*\n    * Given the user name, look up the password. Returning true without\n    * setting the password tells the authentication engine to ask the peer\n    * for the user name again.\n    */\n   public boolean requested(String mechanism,\n      int count,\n      String userName,\n      AuthRequest[] requests) {\n   char[] password = mUserNamePassword.get(userName);\n\n   if (password != null) {\n      for (AuthRequest request : requests) {\n         if (request instanceof PasswordRequest) {\n            ((PasswordRequest) request).setPassword(password);\n         }\n      }\n   }\n   return true;\n   }\n   public void completed(String mechanism, boolean authenticated) {\n   }\n}  When the  requested()  method is called, it makes a  PasswordRequest \nand a  LogonEntryRequest . Since only passwords are provided,\nthe  LogonEntryRequest  has been ignored. The sample above has\ncreated a HashMap that contains two user names and two passwords.\nWhen the  requested()  callback method is called, it contains\nthe user name that can be used to obtain the password from the\nHashMap. If the password matches the password provided by\nthe client, the authentication is completed. If a password\nwas not provided, the client is asked to once again provide\na user name and password. If the service is unable to obtain\nthe password from the user name, it requests the user name and password again.  Code 35. SRP Logon AuthListener - client  class SrpLogonListener implements AuthListener {\n\nstatic class SrpLogonListener implements AuthListener {\n   public boolean requested(String mechanism,\n         String peerName,\n         int count,\n         String userName,\n         AuthRequest[] requests) {\n   /*\n    * Collect the requests we're interested in to simplify\n    * processing below.\n    */\n   PasswordRequest passwordRequest = null;\n   UserNameRequest userNameRequest = null;\n   for (AuthRequest request : requests) {\n      if (request instanceof PasswordRequest) {\n         passwordRequest = (PasswordRequest) request;\n      } else if (request instanceof UserNameRequest) {\n         userNameRequest = (UserNameRequest) request;\n      }\n   }\n\n   if (count  = 3) {\n      System.out.print( Please enter user name [user1]:  );\n      Scanner in = new Scanner(System.in);\n      String user = in.nextLine();\n\n      System.out.print( Please enter password [password1]:  );\n      String password = in.nextLine();\n\n      userNameRequest.setUserName(user);\n      passwordRequest.setPassword(password.toCharArray());\n      return true;\n   }\n   return false;\n}\n\npublic void completed(String authMechanism,\n      String authPeer,\n      boolean authenticated) {\n   if (!authenticated) {\n      System.out.println( Authentication failed. );\n   }\n}\n}  The  requested()  method requests both the  PasswordRequest \nand the  UserNameRequest . Here we have asked the user to\nenter both user name and password. Since this is sample code,\nwe are also revealing the user name and password which\nnormally would not be done unless it is a guest account.\nIf the supplied user name and password match the user name\nand password at the server, the authentication completes.\nIf the user name and password do not match, the user gets\nup to three tries to enter the correct user name and password\nbefore the authentication fails.  Code for RSA key exchange  RSA is an encryption method that has been successfully used\nfor online commerce for years. It consists of the exchange of\nwhat is called a public key. The public key can be used to\nencrypt data but cannot be used to decrypt the data. To be able\nto decrypt the data, the receiver would use their private key.\nIf the data were encrypted using their public key, they can read\nthe data contents but no one else can. To make private keys\neven more secure, they are typically encrypted using a password.\nTo decrypt the private key, the password must be known.  The RSA key exchange certificate chain requires three things:   A private key  A password used to encrypt the private key  An X.509 certificate (a standard public key structure)   The X.509 certificate contains the public key as well as\nadditional information such as who issued the key and\nhow long the key is valid.  If you have the three required elements, you can provide them\nto the AuthListener when they are  requested() . If you have\nnot generated the required elements, the code can automatically\ngenerate them for you.   Figure: MSC RSA key exchange option 1  For this option, both sender and receiver have all the full\nRSA certificate chain needed: their own private keys, certificates,\nand the password used for private key encryption. When the sender\ncalls the remote method call to an unverified receiver, the sender\nis asked to provide the RSA certificate chain. Once the RSA\ncertificate chain has been provided, the receiver also requests\nthe RSA certificate chain. The receiver then sends out a verify\nrequest. This gives the receiver an opportunity to inspect the\ncertificate sent from the sender. The receiver can inspect the\ncertificate and accept or reject the certificate based on\ninformation such as who issued the certificate.   Figure: MSC RSA key exchange option 2  For this option the sender does not have the RSA certificate\nchain needed for RSA authentication. The code can generate a\nself-signed RSA private key and X.509 certificate for the user.\nThe user only needs to supply the password needed to encrypt the\nprivate key. If multiple authentication requests are made,\nthe sender reuses the private key and certificate generated.\nIt is important that each additional request for password\nuses the same password. If a different password is supplied,\nyou receive an error stating that you are unable to decrypt\nthe RSA private key. It is possible to find out if this is\nthe first time the password is being generated by calling AuthListener.PasswordRequest.isNewPassword()  method.   Figure: MSC RSA key exchange option 3  In this option, neither the sender nor the receiver have the\nRSA elements or they were already generated. Both sides ask\nfor their private key password. The sender and receiver can\nchoose differing passwords since the password is only used\nfor their own private key which is not shared with the other device.   Figure 10: MSC RSA key exchange option 4  With this option the receiver side generates its own private key and certificate.  When using a secure interface, an authentication listener must\nbe created that handles connection authentication. The authentication\nlistener decides if the connecting client is a trusted client\nand if they should be allowed to use the interface.  Code 36. Registering the authentication listener  BusAttachment mBus;\nmBus = new BusAttachment(  MyAppName , BusAttachment.RemoteMessage.Receive);\n\nRsaKeyXListener mAuthListener;\n\nStatus status = mBus.registerAuthListener( ALLJOYN_RSA_KEYX ,\n   mAuthListener);\nif (status != Status.OK) {\n   finish();\n   return;\n}  The rest of the steps for connecting and advertising the service\nare detailed in  Discovery and sessions \nand are unchanged for a secure interface.  Code 37. RSA key exchange AuthListener - service and client \ndemonstrates the auth listener for MSC RSA key exchange option 3,\nand would work for both the service and client.  Code 37.

This code does not\nprovide the private key or the X.509 certificate but still\nreturns true for the CertificateRequest. The code tries to\nsee if it has already generated a private key and a self-signed\ncertificate. If it has generated a private key and a self-signed\ncertificate, it asks for the password that was used to generate\nthe key and certificate. If it has not generated a private key\nand self-signed certificate, it asks for a password to do so.\nIn both instances you receive a PasswordRequest. The only way\nto tell if the private key and certificate have already been\ngenerated is to check if this is a request for a new password: passwordRequest.isNewPassword() . It is important to remember\nthe password, because the same password is expected on each\nadditional authentication attempt. Both the client and the\nservice handle RSA authentication identically, and there is\nno difference between the service  AuthListener  and the\nclient  AuthListener .  If you do not want the AllJoyn framework generating your\nprivate key and X.509 certificate for you, then you need to\nprovide the private key, the password used to encrypt the\nprivate key, and the X.509 certificate. For the following sample,\nthe private key and certificate were generated using openssl.\nFor most systems, openssl is required to run the AllJoyn framework.\nYou might already have it installed on your system (openssl is\nnot required for all installations of Windows). Many other tools\nare available to create the private key and certificate;\nif you are familiar with those tools feel free to use them.  See openssl's documentation for creating keys and certificates:  http://www.openssl.org/docs/HOWTO/keys.txt  http://www.openssl.org/docs/HOWTO/certificates.txt  To create a private key the following command was used:  $ openssl genrsa -des3 -out privkey.pem 2048  You are asked to enter a pass phrase; the pass phrase \"pass\" was chosen.  This generates a private key that is 2048 bits in length.\n2048 or higher is recommended for RSA keys.  The private key is then used to generate the X.509 certificate  $ openssl req -new -x509 -key privkey.pem -out cacert.pem -days 3650  You are asked to provide the following for the certificate:   The pass phrase for privkey.pem  Country name (2 letter code)  State or province name (full name)  Locality name (e.g., city)  Organization name  Organization unit name  Common name (e.g., YOUR name)  Email address   This certificate is valid for just under 10 years from the date\nof its creation.

The code above simply returns true when the  verifyRequest \nis received. The full process of verifying the certificate\nis beyond the scope of this document. Code 39. Obtaining the X.509 certificate for verification \nshows how to gain access to the certificate so that it can be verified.  Code 39.

The certificate path can be validated\nagainst a list of  trustedAnchors  (not shown in this code).\nAll of our samples used self-signed certificates so there\nis no certificate path of authority. You would have to add\nyourself to the list of trusted anchors if this method of\nverification is used.  There are many things that could be checked in the  VerifyRequest \nother than checking the certificate path of authority. For example,\nyou could reject any certificate that was not valid for more than 10 days.  PIN key exchange  PIN key exchange only uses a password for identity verification.\nAuthentication using PIN key exchange is very similar to\nSRP key exchange:   There is a one-time password exchange.  Once the authentication is completed the client and server\ncan communicate without asking for passwords to be entered.  Even after the program is closed and restarted the\nauthentication is still valid.   The following figure shows the sequence in which the callback\nmethods are instantiated for a PIN key exchange. This message\nsequence chart is identical to the MSC SRP key exchange diagram.   Figure: MSC PIN key exchange  Code 40. Registering the authentication listener  shows\nregistering an AuthListener with the name SrpKeyXListener.\nThe code for the SrpKeyXListener is shown in Code 31. SRP key exchange AuthListener - service  for the service and Code 32. SRP key exchange AuthListener - client  for the client.\nYes, we are re-using the SrpKeyXListener for PIN key exchange.  Code 40. Registering the authentication listener  BusAttachment mBus;\nmBus = new BusAttachment( myProgramName ,\nBusAttachment.RemoteMessage.Receive);\nSrpKeyXListener myAuthListener;\nStatus status = mBus.registerAuthListener( ALLJOYN_PIN_KEYX ,\n   myAuthListener);\nif (status !=\n   Status.OK) {\n   finish();\n   return;\n}  When registering the AuthListener, here we are reusing the\nsame authentication listener that was created for the\nSRP key exchange sample above. The only change needed to\nuse PIN key exchange is that, when registering the AuthListener,\nthe type of security the AuthListener is responsible for handling\nwas changed from ALLJOYN_SRP_KEYX to ALLJOYN_PIN_KEYX.  ECDHE_NULL key exchange  The ECDHE_NULL keyexchange is purely anonymous. It does not\nrequire any input from the application.

Authentication using PSK key exchange is very\nsimilar to SRP key exchange:   There is a one-time pre-shared secret exchange.  Once the authentication is completed, the client and server\ncan communicate without asking for pre-shared secret to be entered.  Even after the program is closed and restarted the\nauthentication is still valid.

The ECC\ncurve currently supported is the NIST P-256 curve.   If the application provides a private key and certificate\nchain in the PrivateKeyRequest and CertificateRequest, then\nthe AllJoyn framework will send the certificate chain to the\nother peer for validation via the VerifyRequest.  Once the authentication is completed, the client and server\ncan communicate without asking for the keys.  Even after the program is closed and restarted, the\nauthentication is still valid.   The following figure shows the sequence in which the callback\nmethods are instantiated for an ECDHE_ECDSA key exchange.

Registering the authentication listener with ECDHE_ECDSAKeyXListener \nshows registering an AuthListener with the name ECDHE_ECDSAKeyXListener.  Code 46. Registering the authentication listener with ECDHE_ECDSAKeyXListener  BusAttachment mBus;\nmBus = new BusAttachment( myProgramName , BusAttachment.RemoteMessage.Receive);\n\n   ECDHE_PSKKeyXListener myAuthListener;\n   Status status = mBus.registerAuthListener( ALLJOYN_ECDHE_ECDSA ,\nmyAuthListener); if (status !=\nStatus.OK) { finish(); return;\n}  The default keystore listener  So far, we have not discussed where the keys exchanged during\nthe authentication process are stored. If we register the\nAuthListener using the two-parameter method, we are using\nthe default keystore listener with its default options.\nThis uses a default location for storing the keystore.\nThe name of the keystore is the same as the application\nname that was used when creating the new BusAttachment.\nThe default location for the keystore differs depending\non the operating system that is being used. The default\nlocation chosen is a location that the user has permission\nto read and write from.  For Windows XP, the file is in:  C:\\Documents and Settings\\ user_name \\.alljoyn_keystore\\ Application name   For Windows 7, the file is in:  C:\\Users\\ user_name \\.alljoyn_keystore\\ Application name   For Linux, the file is in:  /home/ user_name /.alljoyn_keystore/ Application name   The default location and name of the keystore file can be\nchanged by providing a third parameter. The third parameter\ncan be used to specify the location where the keystore is\nwritten. Note that the location provided as the third parameter\nwhen registering the AuthListener is appended to the location\nof the home folder for the OS being used. The code must\nhave read/write permissions to access that location.  Code 47. Overriding the default file location when registering an AuthListener  BusAttachment bus;\nbus = new BusAttachment( MyApp , BusAttachment.RemoteMessage.Receive);\nString strFilePath = File.separator +  foo  + File.separator +  fileName.ks ;\nStatus status = mBus.registerAuthListener( ALLJOYN_SRP_KEYX ,\n   mAuthListener,\n   strFilePath);  This places the file in the users home directory in a folder\nnamed foo. The file is called fileName.ks.   C:\\Documents and Settings\\ user_name \\foo\\fileName.ks  (Windows XP)  C:\\Users\\ user_name \\foo\\fileName.ks  (Windows 7)  /home/ user_name /foo/fileName.ks  (Linux)   NOTE:  The three-parameter option should be used when registering\nan authListener in Android (see  Security ).  Multiple applications can share a single keystore; however, the\ncode needs to know that the keystore is being shared between\nmultiple applications or it overrides changes made by other\napplications. To use a shared keystore you must specify that\nthe keystore is shared when registering the authListener.  Code 48. Registering AuthListeners with a shared keystore  BusAttachment bus;\nbus = new BusAttachment( MyApp , BusAttachment.RemoteMessage.Receive);\nString strFilePath = File.separator +  .alljoyn_keystore  + File.separator +\n\n    shared.ks ;\nStatus status = mBus.registerAuthListener( ALLJOYN_SRP_KEYX ,\n   mAuthListener,\n   strFilePath,\n   true);  Every application that wants to share the same keystore should\npoint to the same keystore file and set the isShared option to\ntrue when registering an  AuthListener .  Why would you want multiple applications to share a keystore file?\nThis allows you to set up a family of applications that authenticate\nas one. Once one of the applications has completed authentication,\nthen all of the applications can use the same set of keys.\nThis means that only one authentication request is needed,\neven though multiple applications use a secure interface.\nUnder the AllJoyn framework's default mode, authentication\nis done on an app-per-app basis, not as a family of applications.  AllJoyn debug log output  The AllJoyn framework has a built-in logging system for\ninvestigating AllJoyn-related issues. Only critical log output\nis displayed when using the AllJoyn Release mode.  To enable AllJoyn debugging three things must be done:   Set the OS Logging option (OS-specific).  Set the Debug Level for the module(s) of interest (on\nthe router or the application).  Set ER_DEBUG_* environment variable (only needed when\nlogging to  stderr ).   These can be accessed using the following method calls:  BusAttachment.useOSLogging (Boolean useOSLog );\nBusAttachment.setDebugLevel(String module, int level);\nBusAttachment.setLogLevels(String logEnv);\nBusAttachnent.setDaemonDebug(String module, int level);  Set OS-specific logging option  The  BusAttachment.useOSLogging  command results in different\nbehavior depending on what OS the AllJoyn code is running on,\nas shown in the following table.  OS-specific logging behavior     OS  True  False      Windows  Debugger Trace Log  stderr    Windows RT  Win RT Trace Log  Win RT File Log    Linux  stderr  stderr    Android  LogCat  stderr    Mac  stderr  stderr     For  BusAttachment.useOSLogging(true)  on Windows and Windows RT, see:    OutputDebugString function  (Windows)\nhttp://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/windows/desktop/aa363362(v=vs.85).aspx    For  BusAttachment.useOSLogging(false)  on Windows RT, a file named alljoyn.log\nwill be created in the user's  Documents  directory.    Set debug level for modules  The AllJoyn framework has a large number of modules, with new\nmodules being added as it continues to be developed. Several module\nnames of interest are:   ALL - print all modules  ALLJOYN_JAVA - trace log for the JNI layer of the Java Bindings  ALLJOYN - trace of AllJoyn method calls  ALLJOYN_OBJ - trace of AllJoyn object to name service calls  NS - the TCP name service   Each module can print out four debug levels:  High Level = 0b0001  Debug Messages = 0b0010  API Trace = 0b0100  Data Dump = 0b1000  As a general rule, you want a debug level and all the debug\noptions below that option. For example:  1 = \"High Level\"  3 = \"High Level\" and \"Debug Messages\"  7 = \"High Level\", \"Debug Messages\", and \"API trace\"  15 = \"High Level\", \"Debug Messages\", \"API trace\", and \"Data Dump\"  The following code would print the High Level log for ALL\nof the AllJoyn modules and the API trace and below log\nfor the ALLJOYN module:  BusAttachment.setDebugLevel( ALL , 1);\nBusAttachment.setDebugLevel( ALLJOYN , 7);  The same could be achieved using the following code:  BusAttachment.setLogLevels( ALL=1;ALLJOYN=7 );  If your application is using a separate AllJoyn router\nor it is using the built-in name discovery/advertisement\nservices, the logs from this part of the AllJoyn framework\nwill not output logs unless you use the following call:  BusAttachnent.setDaemonDebug( ALL , 7);  NOTE:  There is an error debug level that is always printed\nand cannot be turned off.  Set ER_DEBUG_* environment variable  When logging to stderr, an environment variable must also\nbe specified to obtain the debug log. This is a consequence\nof the AllJoyn logging system being written in C++.  Normally when using a C++ program the user would only need\nto specify the module they are interested in using environment\nvariables. For example:  export ER_DEBUG_ALLJOYN_OBJ=15  With Java you will generally use:\n* Linux\n   sh\n  export ER_DEBUG_ALL=15   Windows   bat\n  set ER_DEBUG_ALL=15  Log output  If everything is set up as expected you should be log output as follows:  ````\n6710.723 DEBUG  THREAD  external    ...n\\os\\windows\\Thread.cc:352 |\n   Thread::Join() thread is dead [replyTimer]\n6710.724 HL_DBG THREAD  external    ...n\\os\\windows\\Thread.cc:185 |\n   Thread::~Thread() [replyTimer,738e6b0] started:3 running:3 stopped:0\n6710.725 DEBUG  ALLJOYN_JAVA external   ...a\\jni\\alljoyn_java.cc:3942 |\n   JBusAttachment::Connect(): Taking Bus Attachment authentication listener change lock\n6710.742 DEBUG  ALLJOYN_JAVA external   ...a\\jni\\alljoyn_java.cc:4145 |\n   JBusAttachment::EnablePeerSecurity()\n6710.743 TRACE  ALLJOYN external    ...e\\src\\BusAttachment.cc:359 |\n   BusAttachment::TryConnect to tcp:addr=127.0.0.1,port=9956\n6710.744 HL_DBG ALLJOYN external    ...ows\\ClientTransport.cc:136 |\n   ClientTransport::Connect(): tcp:addr=127.0.0.1,port=9956\nInitialized winsock\n6710.764 TRACE  NETWORK external    ...n\\os\\windows\\Socket.cc:164 |\n   Socket(addrFamily = 2, type = 1, sockfd =  )\n6710.766 TRACE  NETWORK external    ...n\\os\\windows\\Socket.cc:188 |\n   Connect(sockfd = 612, remoteAddr = 127.0.0.1, remotePort = 9956)\n6711.827 HL_DBG ALLJOYN external    ...ows\\ClientTransport.cc:175 |\n   ClientTransport(): socket Connect() failed ER_CONN_REFUSED\n6711.828 TRACE  NETWORK external    ...n\\os\\windows\\Socket.cc:361 |\n   Close (sockfd = 612)\n6711.831 TRACE  ALLJOYN external    ...e\\src\\BusAttachment.cc:359 |\n   BusAttachment::TryConnect to null:\nUsing BundledRouter  \nThere are five columns for each log message printed out:\n\n1.

Which line of source code printed the message  |  the debug message.\n\n## Android-Specific Considerations\n\n### UI thread vs. AllJoyn bus thread\n\nWhen Android starts a new activity, a thread is created that\ndraws all of the user interface elements on the screen.\nBy default, all code that is added to the activity also runs\nin the same thread. Android always expects the user interface\n(UI) to be responsive. If a function is called that takes too\nlong to process information, the application is terminated by\nAndroid simply because the UI was unresponsive.\n\nAllJoyn applications typically conform to the client/server model;\nthe application is either providing a service or requesting something\nfrom a service. The service could be on a remote device or on\nthe same device. There are no time guarantees when calling an\nAllJoyn method. For this reason, all calls to an AllJoyn method\nor signal must be done in a thread that is independent of the\nmain UI thread.\n\nThis could be done by creating a new thread each time you call\na signal or method associated with the AllJoyn framework.\nThis can result in many threads being created including all\nthe memory usage associated with each thread. If too many\nthreads are created, the application could quickly run out\nof memory and crash. This could easily happen if signals\nwere being used to constantly update something like a game.\n\nTo avoid using a separate thread for each AllJoyn call,\nwe suggest you create a Handler on a separate thread that\nqueues AllJoyn method and signal calls.\n\n### Using Handler Looper\n\nCreate an implementation of a Handler that takes a Looper\nas its initialization parameter.\n\n#### Code 49. BusHandler class that extends the Handler class\n\n```java\nclass BusHandler extends Handler {\n   public BusHandler(Looper looper) {\n      super(looper);\n   }\n\n   @Override\n   public void handleMessage(Message msg) {\n      switch (msg.what) {\n      default:\n         break;\n      }\n   }\n}  Now all of the AllJoyn method calls and signal calls can be\nplaced inside the switch statement found in the  handleMessage  method.  Almost all programs that use the AllJoyn framework need to\nimplement a connect case and a disconnect case, as well as a\ncase for each AllJoyn method, property, and signal.  To start the BusHandler, use the following code:  Code 50. Starting the BusHandler class  BusHandler mBusHandler;\nHandlerThread busThread = new HandlerThread( BusHandler );\nbusThread.start();\nmBusHandler = new BusHandler(busThread.getLooper());  The  /java/samples folder in the Android SDK\ncontains a large number of samples that all show how to\nuse the BusHandler.  Security  In the AllJoyn Java API, there are two  BusAttachment.registerAuthListener(...)  methods.\nOne takes two arguments, and the other takes three arguments.\nWhen registering the authentication listener, the one with\nthree arguments should be used. The third argument sets the\nname of the keystore. It is recommended to always set this\nto  getFileStreamPath(\"alljoyn_keystore\").getAbsolutePath() \nfor all Android programs.  Peer Permission Check  In Android's security model, each application must request\npermission to access certain system resources. For example, android.permission.READ_CONTACTS  is required to access\nthe contact information on an Android device.  In catering to the security model of Android, the AllJoyn framework\nallows the service to impose permission requirements on\nAllJoyn method/signal calls. If the service specifies the\npermission requirements on a call, the client must acquire\nthose permissions by declaring them in the  AndroidManifest.xml \nin order to invoke the call. If a client has not added the\nproper permissions to the  AndroidManifest.xml , the AllJoyn\nmethod/signal call made by the client is rejected. If it is\nan AllJoyn method call, the router sends back an error message (status = ER_ALLJOYN_ACCESS_PERMISSION_ERROR)  to the caller.\nMultiple permissions should be concatenated into a single\nstring using a semicolon (;) as the delimiter, for example:  android.permission.X;android.permission.Y  By using the access permission in the interface, we are\npreventing a client application from accessing data without\nalso requesting the same device permission level as the service.  IMPORTANT: \n   The peer permission check model only applies when\n   the service/client are on the same device. If the service\n   and client are on different devices, the peer permission\n   check will have no effect. The device-to-device trust model\n   should be based on Authentication.  Android's security model does not apply to other OSs. If the\n   AllJoyn framework is used to synch contact and calendar data\n   with a desktop computer, the computer is not expected to obtain\n   permission to read and write the calendar and contacts.\n   The application installed on the Android device that is\n   communicating with the computer would still be required to\n   have Android permissions to access the information of interest.  Code 51. Adding the @AccessPermission annotation for an AllJoyn Java interface  @BusInterface (name =  org.alljoyn.bus.addressbook )\npublic interface AddressBookInterface {\n   /*\n    * The AccessPermission annotation signifies that this function uses\n    * system resources that require system permission\n    *  android.permission.READ_CONTACTS . Thus\n    * the application should declare the required permissions in its\n    * manifest file. If there are more than one permission item,\n    * they should be separated by ';'.\n    */\n   @BusMethod(signature =  si , replySignature =  r )\n   @AccessPermission( android.permission.READ_CONTACTS )\n   public Contact getContact(String name, int userId) throws BusException;\n\n   /*\n    * the replySignature indicates that this BusMethod will return an\n    * array of structs.\n    */\n   @BusMethod(replySignature =  ar )\n   @AccessPermission( android.permission.READ_CONTACTS )\n   public NameId[] getAllContactNames() throws BusException;\n}  Bundled Router (Deprecated)  If you are using AllJoyn framework 2.6, the concept of bundled\nrouter is no longer present. A developer can still get all the\nfunctionality that was available with bundled daemon in\nAllJoyn 2.3.6 but there is no requirement to add the additional\nlibrary (bundle.jar) to the Android app or to use the extra\ncalls that were explicitly needed to use bundle router.\nHowever, the function call  org.alljoyn.bus.alljoyn.DaemonInit.PrepareDaemon(getApplicationContext());  is now used for an entirely different purpose as explained in Using ICE with the AllJoyn Framework .  Using ICE with the AllJoyn Framework  The AllJoyn framework does what it is supposed to do; wonderfully.\nHowever, it cannot control certain things like the network setup\nover which it talks. A common example is wireless isolation.\nWhat is wireless isolation?  Imagine yourself sitting in a coffee shop and wanting to play a\ngame with your friend that uses the AllJoyn framework. In a normal\nhome setup you would be connected to your home access point and\nthis would work seamlessly. In a coffee shop or public place the\nnetwork administrators set up the access points such that two peers\ncannot talk to each other directly. Things like multicast and\nbroadcast are disabled in the coffee shop to avoid bandwidth\nproblems for other users - something that could happen if a\nyoung college student were to set up his own peer-to-peer network\nin the coffee shop with his friends or use an application\n(not using the AllJoyn framework) which floods the network\nwith multicast/broadcast packets.  The philosophy of the AllJoyn framework is to make it unnecessary\nfor the developer to be aware of such network complexities and\nstill achieve what the AllJoyn framework originally delivers - easy\nservice discovery and connectivity without having to change\nanything depending on the network or platform. To overcome\nthe problem of wireless isolation, we added in a parallel\ntransport in the AllJoyn framework that we call ICE.\nICE makes sure that you are able to discover services/devices\nand connect to them even if the access point you are connected\nto does not allow this to happen directly through it.  ICE is not only a way to solve the wireless isolation problem,\nit also provides another means to detect proximity with other\ndevices to aid in service discovery. To do this ICE needs to\nknow the list of access points around you. It does this by\ntalking to the Android framework from your AllJoyn app.\nFor this reason you need to specify the call:  org.alljoyn.bus.alljoyn.DaemonInit.PrepareDaemon(getApplicationContext());  An ideal place to call this is just before you create a\nBusAttachment in your Android application. The application context\nis required so that the internal AllJoyn Java framework can\nget a list of access points around you by talking to the Android framework.  Permissions to Add to your AllJoyn Android App  Under the hood, the AllJoyn framework does a lot of different\nthings on different platforms for device discovery without\nmaking the developer aware of the complexities involved.\nOn Android, it requires that the developer of the app grant\nthe app a set of four permissions so that the AllJoyn discovery works seamlessly.  The two permissions below are required because traditionally\nthe AllJoyn framework uses multicast for device discovery and\nthe Android framework requires any app that intends to use\nmulticast to have these permissions.  uses-permission\nandroid:name= android.permission.INTERNET /uses-permission  uses-permission\nandroid:name= android.permission.CHANGE_WIFI_MULTICAST_STATE /uses-permission   The two permissions below are required when you do not want\nto worry about wireless isolation that may be present on the\nnetwork to which you are connected. These two permissions let\nthe AllJoyn framework deal with it using ICE. These permissions\nenable the AllJoyn framework to look for wireless access points\naround you and use this data to detect if you are in proximity\nto any other device.  uses-permission\nandroid:name= android.permission.ACCESS_WIFI_STATE /uses-permission  uses-permission\nandroid:name= android.permission.CHANGE_WIFI_STATE /uses-permission   ProGuard  ProGuard is one of the tools packaged with the Android SDK.\nProGuard is used to shrink, optimize, and obfuscate code when\nproducing a release version of an .apk file. After using ProGuard,\nthe resulting .apk is smaller and more difficult to reverse engineer.\nFor more information, see http://developer.android.com/guide/developing/tools/proguard.html.  Knowing the names of methods, interfaces, annotations, and\nclasses is important for the AllJoyn framework to operate\nproperly. If the code is passed through ProGuard the names\nwill be changed, annotations will be removed and AllJoyn code\nwill no longer function as expected. To use ProGuard, the\nproguard.cfg file must have additional options added.

This is especially true when the contents of the\nsignal are really small.  Header compression can be used to improve performance.\nSince setting up header compression is an expensive operation,\nit should not be used except for repetitive signals.  An example would be a game that wants to constantly update\nits player's positions. The same signal would be repetitively\nsent with the new player position. Header compression could\nbe used to reduce the size of the signal.  Code 53.

It is good practice to shut off discovery when an interface\nhas been found even when using TCP/IP. Leaving discovery\nrunning could have an impact on battery life and network\nperformance since the routing node continues to access the\nradio to look for remote services.  Code 54.

This creates a large amount\nof network traffic.

You now should see\nyour HelloAllJoynWorld project loaded in Xcode. You are\nready to begin your journey into AllJoyn\n development.\n\n\n\n\nDefine the AllJoyn Object Model\n\n\nTo offer a service that does some useful work for a client,\nyou must define and implement the service's interface.\n\n\nFor this example, we will create a simple interface with a\nsingle method that will concatenate two strings and return\nthe result.

All you need to do is provide the Objective-C\ncode to fill in the implementation of each member exposed by\nthe interfaces of your service's bus object.\n\n\nBefore we can run the code generator, though, we need to\ncompose a representation of the service, or bus object, in XML,\nwhich is the format the code generator expects. As a side note,\nthe format of the XML conforms to the standard used by D-Bus.\nThe AllJoyn framework implements the D-Bus specification, and\nhence is compatible with other D-Bus-enabled applications.\nFor more information on D-Bus, you can look up the latest\nDBus specifications online.\n\n\nIn your HelloAllJoynWorld Xcode project, add a new file called\n\nSimpleAllJoynObjectModel.xml\n that will contain a description\nof the interface your service will support.\n\n\n\n\nRight-click on the \nHelloAllJoynWorld group\n folder in the\nproject \nNavigator\n on the right side of the Xcode view.\n\n\nSelect \nNew File...\n from the menu to bring up the template chooser.\n\n\nUnder iOS, select the \nOther\n template group and then\nselect \nEmpty\n in the list of available templates. Click \nNext\n to proceed.\n\n\nType in the name of your new file, \nSampleAllJoynObjectModel.xml\n.\n\n\nClick \nCreate\n to create your new XML file and add it to\nthe Xcode project.\n\n\nSelect the \nSampleAllJoynObjectModel.xml\n file in the\nproject \nNavigator\n, and add the following XML text:\n\n\n\n\nxml\n   \nxml\n\n      \nnode name=\"org/alljoyn/Bus/sample\"\n\n         \nannotation name=\"org.alljoyn.lang.objc\" value=\"SampleObject\"/\n\n         \ninterface name=\"org.alljoyn.bus.sample\"\n\n            \nannotation name=\"org.alljoyn.lang.objc\" value=\"SampleObjectDelegate\"/\n\n            \nannotation name=\"org.alljoyn.lang.objc.announced\" value=\"true\"/\n\n            \nmethod name=\"Concatentate\"\n\n               \narg name=\"str1\" type=\"s\" direction=\"in\"\n\n                  \nannotation name=\"org.alljoyn.lang.objc\" value=\"concatenateString:\"/\n\n               \n/arg\n\n               \narg name=\"str2\" type=\"s\" direction=\"in\"\n\n                  \nannotation name=\"org.alljoyn.lang.objc\" value=\"withString:\"/\n\n               \n/arg\n\n               \narg name=\"outStr\" type=\"s\" direction=\"out\"/\n\n            \n/method\n\n         \n/interface\n\n      \n/node\n\n   \n/xml\n\n\nYou now have a description of the bus object that your service\nwill expose to its clients. Let's go line by line through the\nXML to build an understanding of the format and how it describes\nour bus object.\n\n\nxml\n\n\n\n\n\nThe first line, shown above, is standard for all XML documents.\n\n\nnode name=\norg/alljoyn/Bus/sample\n\n\n\n\n\nThe second line declares an element named \"node\" which corresponds\nwith the bus object our service will expose. A name attribute\non the node element defines the object path. In the D-Bus XML format,\nnode elements contain interface elements that can contain method,\nproperty and signal elements. Node elements may also contain\nother child node elements, but let's keep it simple for now.\n\n\nannotation name=\norg.alljoyn.lang.objc\n value=\nSampleObject\n/\n\n\n\n\n\nThe next line declares an annotation element. Annotations are\nused to store metadata about a node, interface, method, signal\nor property element. Annotations are name-value pairs that\ncan contain virtually any data. In the context of the AllJoyn\nframework for iOS, annotations named \"org.alljoyn.lang.objc\"\nare used to give the code generator hints as far as naming\nis concerned. In this instance, the annotation element gives\nthe code generator a hint on what to name the object at\npath /org/alljoyn/Bus/sample. The annotation tells the code\ngenerator to give the object a friendly name of \"SampleObject\"\nin any Objective-C code emitted.\n\n\ninterface name=\norg.alljoyn.bus.sample\n\n\nannotation name=\norg.alljoyn.lang.objc\n value=\nSampleObjectDelegate\n/\n\n\nannotation name=\norg.alljoyn.lang.objc.announced\n value=\ntrue\n/\n\n\n\n\n\nOn the above lines, an interface element named org.alljoyn.bus.sample\nis created. Interface elements contain method, signal and\nproperty elements, as well as annotation elements.\n\n\nThe first annotation tells the code generator to create an Objective-C\nprotocol for the interface and name it SampleObjectDelegate.\nAll interfaces on bus objects are implemented in Objective-C\nas protocols.\n\n\nThe second annotation tells the code generator that the objects implementing\nthis interface must be announced through the About discovery mechanism. The code\ngenerator will generate the necessary code to make this happen.\n\n\nmethod name=\nConcatentate\n\n    \narg name=\nstr1\n type=\ns\n direction=\nin\n\n        \nannotation name=\norg.alljoyn.lang.objc\n value=\nconcatenateString:\n/\n\n    \n/arg\n\n    \narg name=\nstr2\n type=\ns\n direction=\nin\n\n        \nannotation name=\norg.alljoyn.lang.objc\n value=\nwithString:\n/\n\n    \n/arg\n\n    \narg name=\noutStr\n type=\ns\n direction=\nout\n/\n\n\n/method\n\n\n\n\n\nThe final lines in the XML file shown above describe a method\nnamed Concatenate that takes two strings as arguments and\nreturns one string. A method element can contain 0 to n arg\nchild elements. Each arg element has three attributes:\n\n\n\n\nName\n - The name of the argument.\n\n\nType\n - The type of the element. Per the D-Bus specification,\ndata types are expressed as a string of one or more letters,\ncalled a signature. The letter \"s\" signifies a string data type.\n\n\nDirection\n - Allowed values are \"in\" or \"out\", corresponding\nto input and output parameters respectively.\n\n\n\n\nThe D-Bus interface description format favors a C language style\nfor declaring methods, with a name for a method followed by\nseveral input and output parameters, each with a parameter name.\nObjective-C, however, does not use this syntax when declaring\na method, or more accurately in Objective-C parlance, a message.\nThe message takes the form of a selector, with the complete\nname of the message interspersed with its parameters. Note the\ndifference below:\n\n\nvoid ConcatenateString(in String str1, in String str2, out String outStr);\n\nNSString *concatenateString:(NSString *)str1 withString:(NSString *)str2;\n\n\n\n\nAnnotations help the code generator create message declarations\nthat appeal to our Objective-C sense of good coding style.\nThe arg elements contain an annotation element that specifies\npart of the selector associated with that argument. By processing\nall the arg elements and their child annotations, the code generator\ncan emit the complete selector for the message.\n\n\nBuild and Configure the Code Generator\n\n\nNow that you have familiarized yourself with the D-Bus XML format,\nit is time to generate the code that will allow us to create an\nObjective-C object that you can use in your application.\nThe AllJoynCodeGenerator project is located at the following path:\n\n\nAllJoyn SDK Root\n/alljoyn_objc/AllJoynCodeGenerator\n\n\n\n\nNavigate to the above directory in Finder and double-click\nthe \nAllJoynCodeGenerator.xcodeproj\n file to launch Xcode\nand load the project. In Xcode, select \nProduct \n Build\n to\nbuild the AllJoyn code generator executable. Your new executable\nis now ready for use, and is located in the following directory:\n\n\nAllJoyn SDK Root\n/alljoyn_objc/bin\n\n\n\n\nNow return to your \nHelloAllJoynWorld Xcode\n project, so\nthat you may configure a target and a scheme in Xcode that\nwill launch the code generator and pass the \nSampleAllJoynObjectModel.xml\n\nfile to it.\n\n\n\n\nSelect the HelloAllJoynWorld root node in the \nProject Navigator\n\nview, displayed in the left pane in Xcode, and then click\n\nAdd Target\n located at the bottom of the middle pane.\n\n\nSelect \nOther\n in the OS X list on the left side of the\ndialog and choose the \nExternal Build System\n type for\nyour new target. Click \nNext\n.\n\n\nType \nGenerate Code\n into the \nProduct Name\n field and\nclick \nFinish\n to create your new target and its accompanying scheme.\n\n\nSelect the \nGenerate Code\n target in the list of targets,\nand select the \nInfo\n tab at the top of the middle pane in Xcode.\n\n\nIn the \nBuild Tool\n text field for the \"Generate Code\"\ntarget, enter the full path to your \nAllJoynCodeGenerator\n\nbinary, which should be located in your \nALLJOYN_SDK_ROOT\n/alljoyn_objc/bin\n folder.\n\n\nIn the \nArguments\n text field for the \"Generate Code\"\ntarget, enter the full path to your \nSampleAllJoynObjectModel.xml\n\nfile followed by a space and then \nSampleObject\n, as follows:\n\n\n\n\nsh\n   $(SOURCE_ROOT)/HelloAllJoynWorld/SampleAllJoynObjectModel.xml SampleObject\n\n7. Select the \nGenerate Code\n scheme and set it to your active scheme.\n8. Click \nProduct \n Build\n and the code generator should\nsuccessfully generate your SampleObject code. Add the new files\nto your project by right-clicking on the \nHelloAllJoynWorld\n\ngroup and selecting \nAdd Files To HelloAllJoynWorld\n.\n9. Select the following files and click \nAdd\n:\n\n\nsh\n   AJNSampleObject.h\n   AJNSampleObject.mm\n   SampleObject.h\n   SampleObject.m\n\n\nCongratulations! You now have a skeleton Objective-C implementation\nof your sample AllJoyn bus object.\n\n\nTake a look at the generated code files. As you can see, the\ncode generator takes care of the implementation of most of\nthe boilerplate you would normally need to create by hand\nto work with the AllJoyn C++ API. Also note that the code\nin \nAJNSampleObject.mm\n includes C++ code that interoperates\nwith the Objective-C code contained in \nSampleObject.h/.m\n.\nBy declaring and implementing the C++ classes only within\nthe \nAJNSampleObject.mm\n file and not referring to any C++\nclasses in the header file, the code generator insulates your\napp's code from the AllJoyn C++ API. In this manner, the rest\nof your app can remain as pure Objective-C, rather than forcing\nyou to move your entire project's code to Objective-C++.\n\n\nYour implementation of the logic for \nSampleObject::concatenateString:withString:\n\nshould reside in the \nSampleObject.m\n. You normally should\nnot need to change the code in the \nAJN*.h/.mm\n files in order\nto implement your application.\n\n\nConfigure the Build Settings\n\n\nNow you must configure the Xcode project to successfully\ncompile and link your app.\n\n\n\n\nMake sure you know the location of the AllJoyn SDK folder.\nThe AllJoyn SDK folder contains your build, services, and\nalljoyn_objc folders.\n\n\nFollow the directions in the README file in the AllJoyn SDK\nfolder to compile openssl for iOS using Xcode.\n\n\nOpen Xcode, open your project, and select the root of the\ntree in \nProject Navigator\n.

Let's go line by line through the\nXML to build an understanding of the format and how it describes\nour bus object.  xml   The first line, shown above, is standard for all XML documents.  node name= org/alljoyn/Bus/sample   The second line declares an element named \"node\" which corresponds\nwith the bus object our service will expose. A name attribute\non the node element defines the object path. In the D-Bus XML format,\nnode elements contain interface elements that can contain method,\nproperty and signal elements. Node elements may also contain\nother child node elements, but let's keep it simple for now.  annotation name= org.alljoyn.lang.objc  value= SampleObject /   The next line declares an annotation element. Annotations are\nused to store metadata about a node, interface, method, signal\nor property element. Annotations are name-value pairs that\ncan contain virtually any data. In the context of the AllJoyn\nframework for iOS, annotations named \"org.alljoyn.lang.objc\"\nare used to give the code generator hints as far as naming\nis concerned. In this instance, the annotation element gives\nthe code generator a hint on what to name the object at\npath /org/alljoyn/Bus/sample. The annotation tells the code\ngenerator to give the object a friendly name of \"SampleObject\"\nin any Objective-C code emitted.  interface name= org.alljoyn.bus.sample  annotation name= org.alljoyn.lang.objc  value= SampleObjectDelegate /  annotation name= org.alljoyn.lang.objc.announced  value= true /   On the above lines, an interface element named org.alljoyn.bus.sample\nis created. Interface elements contain method, signal and\nproperty elements, as well as annotation elements.  The first annotation tells the code generator to create an Objective-C\nprotocol for the interface and name it SampleObjectDelegate.\nAll interfaces on bus objects are implemented in Objective-C\nas protocols.  The second annotation tells the code generator that the objects implementing\nthis interface must be announced through the About discovery mechanism. The code\ngenerator will generate the necessary code to make this happen.  method name= Concatentate \n     arg name= str1  type= s  direction= in \n         annotation name= org.alljoyn.lang.objc  value= concatenateString: / \n     /arg \n     arg name= str2  type= s  direction= in \n         annotation name= org.alljoyn.lang.objc  value= withString: / \n     /arg \n     arg name= outStr  type= s  direction= out /  /method   The final lines in the XML file shown above describe a method\nnamed Concatenate that takes two strings as arguments and\nreturns one string. A method element can contain 0 to n arg\nchild elements. Each arg element has three attributes:   Name  - The name of the argument.  Type  - The type of the element. Per the D-Bus specification,\ndata types are expressed as a string of one or more letters,\ncalled a signature. The letter \"s\" signifies a string data type.  Direction  - Allowed values are \"in\" or \"out\", corresponding\nto input and output parameters respectively.   The D-Bus interface description format favors a C language style\nfor declaring methods, with a name for a method followed by\nseveral input and output parameters, each with a parameter name.\nObjective-C, however, does not use this syntax when declaring\na method, or more accurately in Objective-C parlance, a message.\nThe message takes the form of a selector, with the complete\nname of the message interspersed with its parameters. Note the\ndifference below:  void ConcatenateString(in String str1, in String str2, out String outStr);\n\nNSString *concatenateString:(NSString *)str1 withString:(NSString *)str2;  Annotations help the code generator create message declarations\nthat appeal to our Objective-C sense of good coding style.\nThe arg elements contain an annotation element that specifies\npart of the selector associated with that argument. By processing\nall the arg elements and their child annotations, the code generator\ncan emit the complete selector for the message.",

This puts\na burden on the applications however, as they have to take the\ninitiative to do the pinging. Moreover, applications are often\ninterested in an up-to-date state of all remote peers rather\nthan a snapshot view.\n\n\nTo solve this problem, the Auto-Pinger (introduced in R14.12) periodically pings\na supplied list of peers on the application's behalf and notifies the\napplication when they become available or leave.\n\n\nThe Auto-Pinger API is currently only available in the C++ language binding of\nAllJoyn Core.\n\n\nGoal\n\n\nThe Auto-Pinger supplies the application up-to-date information\non which peers are present and which aren't.\n\n\nUsage\n\n\nUsage Details\n\n\nIn many cases, applications will want to handle the presence management of\nsimilar peers (say, all peers with which the application has an ongoing session)\nin a similar way. The AutoPinger class tries to facilitate this with the concept\nof a Ping Group.\n\n\nWhen an AutoPinger instance is created, the application first has to define the\napplicable Ping Groups. Later on, when peers are discovered, the application\ncan add them to one or more Ping Groups (either by unique bus name or by\nwell-known name). The AutoPinger will then periodically perform a \nPing()\n call\nto all peers in all Ping Groups.\n\n\nA Ping Group has the following characteristics:\n\n\n\n\nit is identified with a name (a string).\n\n\nit has an associated \nPingListener\n. This listener object is used to inform\n    the application about changes in the presence of peers, via the\n    \nDestinationLost\n and \nDestinationFound\n callbacks.\n\n\nit has a configurable ping interval. The ping interval is the period with\n    which all members of the Ping Group will be periodically pinged.\n\n\n\n\nThe Ping Group concept offers some advantages:\n\n\n\n\nit allows several independent modules in the same application to reuse the\n    same AutoPinger object: by choosing different group names and installing\n    different listeners, the various modules don't interfere with each other's\n    presence logic.\n\n\nit is convenient to treat many peers in the same way: the application can\n    increase or decrease the ping frequency of a complete group with a single\n    API call. For example, when the application's UI is showing a list of active\n    peers, one could reduce the ping interval for the corresponding Ping Group\n    to show better responsiveness towards the user. When the application no\n    longer displays the screen, the ping interval can be increased again.\n\n\n\n\nThe Auto-Pinger's functionality can be temporarily suspended\n(e.g., when an application on a mobile phone goes to the background)\nby calling the \nPause()\n method. Upon \nResume()\n, the Auto-Pinger continues.\n\n\nExample Usage\n\n\nThe code snippet below implements a primitive presence manager. It leverages the\nAbout discovery mechanism to find all peers on the network that have at least\none bus object implementing the \norg.alljoyn.example.Foo\n interface. It then\nadds all these peers to a single Ping Group. When any of these peers stop\nresponding to ping requests, or resume their ping responses, the appropriate\ncallback is invoked.\n\n\nclass PresenceManager : private ajn::AboutListener,\n                        private ajn::PingListener {\n\n  private:\n    BusAttachment\n bus;\n    AutoPinger autoPinger;\n    std::set\nqcc::String\n peers;\n    static const int PING_INTERVAL = 30; /* seconds */\n    static const char* PING_GROUP = \nallpeers\n;\n\n  public:\n    /* defined in ajn::PingListener */\n    virtual void DestinationLost(const qcc::String\n group, const qcc::String\n destination) {\n        std::cout \n \nPeer \n \n destination \n \n is not responding.\n std::endl;\n    }\n\n    /* defined in ajn::PingListener */\n    virtual void DestinationFound(const qcc::String\n group, const qcc::String\n destination) {\n        std::cout \n \nPeer \n \n destination \n \n responds to ping requests.\n \n std::endl;\n    }\n\n    /* defined in ajn::AboutListener */\n    virtual void Announced(const char* busName,\n                           uint16_t version,\n                           ajn::SessionPort port,\n                           const MsgArg\n objectDescription,\n                           const MsgArg\n aboutData) {\n\n        if (peers.count(busName) == 0) {\n            /* Add destination to ping group */\n            autoPinger.AddDestination(PING_GROUP, busName);\n            peers.insert(busName);\n        }\n    }\n\n    PresenceManager(BusAttachment\n _bus) : bus(_bus), autoPinger(bus) {\n        /* Create a ping group */\n        autoPinger.AddPingGroup(PING_GROUP, *this, PING_INTERVAL);\n\n        /* Configure interface-based discovery */\n        bus.RegisterAboutListener(*this);\n        bus.WhoImplements(\norg.alljoyn.example.Foo\n);\n    }\n\n    ~PresenceManager() {\n        /* Stop interface-based discovery */\n        bus.CancelWhoImplements(\norg.alljoyn.example.Foo\n);\n        bus.UnregisterAboutListener(*this);\n\n        /* Stop AutoPinger */\n        autoPinger.RemovePingGroup(PING_GROUP);\n    }\n};\n\n\n\n\nNote that an actual production-grade implementation of a presence manager would\nbe more complex than this basic example:\n\n\n\n\npeers that stop responding to ping requests should be moved to another Ping\n    Group with a longer interval (to avoid overloading the network with useless\n    ping traffic), or should be removed from the AutoPinger entirely.\n\n\nthe \nAnnounced\n method should check whether any of the announced objects\n    really implements the interface of interest. If the peer removes its last\n    object of interest, the application will receive a final \"negative\"\n    announcement. Upon this negative announcement, the peer should be removed\n    from the Ping Group and from the \npeers\n set.\n\n\n\n\nBest practices\n\n\nChoosing the Right Ping Interval\n\n\nChoosing the right ping interval is always a trade-off between\nhaving the most up-to-date information and not wasting network\nand energy resources. When the application is user facing, there\nare typically higher requirements to the up-to-dateness of the\nremote peer state compared to when the application is in the\nbackground. Also, when a remote peer has not been seen for a\nsignificant amount of time, it's safe to assume the remote peer\nhas gone and you can ping it at a lower interval or even stop\npinging it altogether. When the remote peer starts again,\nit will send a new announcement.\n\n\nModular Applications\n\n\nShare the AutoPinger Instance\n\n\nWhen your application consists of multiple (independently developed) modules,\nyou may want to design your modules in such a way that they can share a single\nAutoPinger instance. Every AutoPinger instance creates a timer thread to manage\nthe periodic invocation of the \nPing()\n method, so less AutoPingers means less\nthreads in your application. In addition, when multiple modules want to keep\ntrack of the same peer, the single AutoPinger can optimize the number of Ping\ncalls it performs towards that peer, thus reducing overall network traffic.\n\n\nAvoid Naming Conflicts\n\n\nIf multiple modules in your application share a single AutoPinger instance, make\nsure they don't interfere with each other's Ping Groups. The simplest approach\nhere is to let every module have its own prefix for its Ping Group names. Hence,\nthe Foo module's \nactive\n group would be called \nFOO.active\n, and be different\nfrom the Bar module's \nactive\n group, which would be called \nBAR.active\n.\n\n\nThreading Considerations\n\n\nThe PingListener callbacks will be invoked on AllJoyn's dispatcher threads.\nThese are the same threads that are used for the invocation of all other\napplication callbacks (asynchronous method replies, SessionListener callback\ninvocations, etc.). If you want to perform any blocking operation (for example,\na synchronous method call) from within a PingListener callback, you must first\ncall \nBusAttachment::EnableConcurrentCallbacks()\n.",

Please refer to the respective\n\nAPI references\n for the language bindings for details on Observer\nusage in the various supported programming languages. In this guide, we'll limit\nourselves mainly to the C++ language binding.\n\n\nCreating an Observer\n\n\nTo create an Observer, you need to supply a BusAttachment and the minimal set of\ninterfaces bus objects must implement to be considered eligible for discovery by\nthe Observer.\n\n\nNote:\n the interface names passed to the Observer must correspond with\ninterfaces that have previously been registered with the BusAttachment (via\n\nBusAttachment::CreateInterface\n and \nInterfaceDescription::Activate\n). If this\nis not the case, the Observer creation will fail silently, and the Observer will\nnot discover any objects on the bus.\n\n\nBusAttachment bus;\nconst char* mandatory[] = { \norg.alljoyn.example.Foo\n, \norg.alljoyn.example.Bar\n };\n\nObserver obs(bus, mandatory, sizeof(mandatory)/sizeof(mandatory[0]));\n\n\n\n\nIt is possible to create different Observers side-by-side, even Observers that\nhave the same set of mandatory interfaces pose no problem.\n\n\nOnce created, the Observer will monitor the About announcements emitted by the\npeers on the bus for objects that implement at least the set of mandatory\ninterfaces. The Observer will set up a session with peers that host at least one\nsuch bus object, and create \nProxyBusObject\ns for each of the discovered\nobjects. These \nProxyBusObject\n instances have support for \nall\n discovered\ninterfaces in the remote object, not just the mandatory interfaces.\n\n\nNote:\n due to the design of the Java language binding, it is not possible to\nmake the Java \nProxyBusObject\ns support all interfaces in the discovered object.\nTherefore, the Java Observer constructor allows you to pass in a second set of\ninterfaces, the so-called \noptional\n interfaces. The \nProxyBusObject\ns created\nby the Java Observer will support all mandatory interfaces, and those optional\ninterfaces that are implemented by the corresponding remote object.\n\n\nGetting Notifications for Discovered and Lost Objects\n\n\nThe Observer supports asynchronous notification of applications via the\n\nObserver::Listener\n class. The listener defines two callbacks:\n\n\n\n\nObjectDiscovered(ProxyBusObject\n proxy)\n is invoked whenever a new remote\n    object is discovered. The proxy object that is passed along into this\n    callback can be used for the registration of PropertiesChanged listeners.\n    The Observer will keep this proxy object around until the corresponding\n    remote object is removed from the bus.\n\n\nObjectLost(ProxyBusObject\n proxy)\n is invoked whenever a previously\n    discovered object is lost. Objects are considered lost if\n    the peer that hosts them issues an About announcement that no longer\n    includes that object, if the session to the hosting peer is\n    lost, or if that peer becomes unresponsive to ping requests.\n\n\n\n\nIt is possible to register multiple listeners to a single Observer. To register\na listener, call \nObserver::RegisterListener\n. This method takes two parameters:\na reference to the listener object, and an optional boolean parameter (true by\ndefault) that states whether the application wants to receive notifications for\nalready-discovered objects.\n\n\nThe latter parameter is necessary because it is possible that the Observer has\nalready discovered various remote objects in the time window between its\nconstruction and the registration of the first listener.\n\n\nclass MyListener : public Observer::Listener {\n  public:\n    virtual void ObjectDiscovered(ProxyBusObject\n proxy) {\n        std::cout \n \nDiscovered object with path \n \n proxy.GetPath();\n        std::cout \n \n from peer \n \n proxy.GetUniqueName() \n std::endl;\n    }\n    virtual void ObjectLost(ProxyBusObject\n proxy) {\n        std::cout \n \nLost object with path \n \n proxy.GetPath();\n        std::cout \n \n from peer \n \n proxy.GetUniqueName() \n std::endl;\n    }\n};\n\nMyListener listener;\nobs.RegisterListener(listener, true);\n\n/* ... */\n\n/* when you're done, there are two ways to unregister a listener */\nobs.UnregisterListener(listener);\n/* or, alternatively */\nobs.UnregisterAllListeners();\n\n\n\n\nRetrieving a Specific Proxy Object\n\n\nBetween the invocation of \nObserver::Listener::ObjectDiscovered\n and\n\nObserver::Listener::ObjectLost\n for the same \nProxyBusObject\n, the Observer\nkeeps a reference to that proxy object around internally. You can iterate over\nall proxies in the Observer (discussed later), or retrieve a specific proxy\nobject.\n\n\nA remote object is uniquely identified by the pair (unique bus name, object\npath). In the C++ language binding, the \najn::ObjectId\n type encapsulates this\npair in a convenient class.\n\n\nTo retrieve a specific proxy object from the Observer, call\n\nObserver::Get(ObjectId id)\n.\n\n\nProxyBusObject proxy = obs.Get(ObjectId(unique_name, \n/some/path\n));\nif (proxy.IsValid()) {\n    // OK, the Observer knows about an object with this identity\n} else {\n    // ouch, the Observer does not know an object with this identity\n}\n\n\n\n\nIterating Over All Discovered Objects\n\n\nTo iterate over all discovered objects, use the \nObserver::GetFirst()\n and\n\nObserver::GetNext()\n methods.\n\n\nfor (ProxyBusObject iter = obs.GetFirst(); iter.IsValid(); iter = obs.GetNext(iter)) {\n    // do something fun with the proxy\n}\n\n\n\n\nBest Practices\n\n\nThreading Model\n\n\nAll \nObserver::Listener\n callbacks are invoked from the BusAttachment's\ndispatcher threads, as is the case for all other application-facing callbacks in\nthe AllJoyn framework (asynchronous method replies, session listener callbacks,\netc.). If you want to perform a blocking or long-running operation in a\ncallback, you should first call \nBusAttachment::EnableConcurrentCallbacks\n.\n\n\nThe Observer has been designed in such a way that it is never possible to have\ntwo ObserverListener callbacks in flight at the same time, not even callbacks\nfrom different listeners associated with different Observer instances.\n\n\nService-side Requirements\n\n\nThe Observer functionality only works well if the service side (i.e. the peer\nthat provides the bus object) plays along nicely. The requirements on the\nservice side are simple:\n\n\n\n\nannounce bus objects and their interfaces through About\n\n\nkeep your application's About announcements up to date: if bus objects are\n    registered or unregistered, be sure to do the appropriate re-announcement\n\n\naccept sessions on the session port your application announces in About.

It is\navailable in the C++, C, Java and Objective-C language bindings of AllJoyn Core.\n\n\nThe purpose of the property cache is to reduce network traffic and to improve\napplication response times by avoiding unnecessary round trips on\n\nProxyBusObject::GetProperty\n and \nProxyBusObject::GetAllProperties\n calls for\n\ncacheable\n properties.\n\n\nOptional Feature\n\n\nThe property caching feature is optional, and not enabled by default. You have\nto enable it on a per-\nProxyBusObject\n basis. Once enabled, it applies to all\ninterfaces that \nProxyBusObject\n instance supports.\n\n\nCacheable Properties\n\n\nCacheable properties are those that leverage the\n\norg.freedesktop.DBus.Properties.PropertiesChanged\n signal mechanism. Such\nproperties are annotated with the\n\norg.freedesktop.DBus.Property.EmitsChangedSignal\n annotation:\n\n\n\n\nif the annotation value is \ntrue\n, clients will be informed of the new value\n    of the property as soon as the value changes.\n\n\nif the annotation value is \ninvalidates\n, clients will be informed that any\n    value they may have cached for that property is now invalid, but the new\n    value is not sent along with the notification.

            "text": "Events and Actions API Guide\n\n\nOverview\n\n\nThe AllJoyn\n Events and Actions feature enables the ability for \nthe discovery of signals and methods that can be understood by \nan end consumer in a user interface. An Event is made up of \nattaching a human readable description to a Signal. An Action \nis made up of attaching a human readable description to a Method.\n\n\nThis feature/function allows a UI-based application to discover \nand list Events and Actions in a user interface, and dynamically \ncreate a handler for the signal (event) to invoke the method \n(action) on the respective devices. The information found \ncan also be used to set a rule in an application with the \nability to listen for events and perform actions, if an application \nsupports this ability. The rule application provides the best \nuser experience when it is always running and connected to the \nuser's home network.\n\n\nArchitecture\n\n\nThe following figure illustrates one possible basic Action/Event \nenvironment that can be built with the Actions and Events feature.\n\n\n\n\nFigure:\n Events and Actions feature sample architecture\n\n\nEvents and Actions sequence flow\n\n\nThe following steps detail the end-to-end flow involving the \nEvents framework, Actions framework, and Event Picker application. \nThe flow assumes the following:\n\n\n\n\nDevices that support the Events interface have been onboarded \nonto the AllJoyn framework and are therefore discoverable on \nthe associated Wi-Fi network.\n\n\nDevices that support the Actions interface have been onboarded \nonto the AllJoyn framework and are therefore discoverable on \nthe associated Wi-Fi network.\n\n\n\n\nHuman readable descriptions have been created as part of \nthe software on the devices to be returned in the introspection XML. \nThese can be created by the OEM, standardized descriptions \nprovided by the AllSeen Alliance can be used.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nA device with the Event Picker application installed \ndiscovers other devices on the network that support the \nEvents interface. The device's UI presents a list of those \ndevices such as TV, washer, and thermostat.\n\n\n\n\nThe Event Picker application introspects the Events interface \non the devices listed in the UI, and presents a list of human \nreadable descriptions in the UI. Example descriptions include \nTV is on, Washer cycle complete, and Thermostat cooling.\n\n\nThe device with the Event Picker application installed \ndiscovers devices on the network that support the Action interface. \nThe device's UI presents a list of those devices such as Kitchen Lights.\n\n\nThe Event Picker application introspects the Action methods \non the devices listed in the UI, and presents a list of human \nreadable descriptions in the UI. The events (TV is on, \nWasher cycle complete, Thermostat cooling) are paired with \na corresponding action that can be completed for that device. \nExamples include Turn light on, Turn light color to blue, \nBlink light three times.\n\n\nThe user can select an event and select an action to \nmap the two. This pairs the event and the action, creating \na rule the user wants to have occur.\n\n\n\n\nAllJoyn Interface Overview\n\n\nThis section walks through an AllJoyn interface and briefly \nexplains the components. This is not intended to be a \nreplacement for understanding how to build an interface \nand design one, but just to set the stage on how Events \nand Actions fit into the core AllJoyn software.\n\n\nInterface structure\n\n\nAllJoyn interfaces are defined as XML and contain specific tags \nthat represent the definition expressed. Every interface has \na \nnode\n tag that indicates the object path in which the defined \ninterfaces exist. Inside a \nnode\n tag contains the list of \ninterfaces defined in \ninterface name=\"SOME_NAME\"\n tags. \nThese interfaces define the specific functionality that are exposed.\n\n\nnode\n tags can be nested; when no name is supplied, the default is \"/\".\n\n\nMethods, Signals, and Properties\n\n\nMethods, Signals, and Properties make up the definition of \nthe interface for its functionality.\n\n\n\n\nA method is defined by a \n tag, Signals \n \nand Properties \n.\n\n\nThe \nmethod\n and \nsignal\n tags allow for \narg\n tags to be \ncontained that define the arguments.\n\n\nA property does not accept arguments as it is only a single type.\n\n\n\n\nExample interface XML\n\n\nnode\n\n  \nnode name=\nchild\n/\n\n\n  \ninterface name=\ncom.example.LightBulb\n\n\n      \nmethod name=\nToggleSwitch\n\n         \narg name=\nbrightess\n type=\ni\n direction=\nin\n/\n\n      \n/method\n\n\n      \nsignal name=\nLightOn\n sessionless=\ntrue\n\n      \n/signal\n\n      \nsignal name=\nLightOff\n sessionless=\ntrue\n\n      \n/signal\n\n\n      \nproperty name=\nLightState\n type=\ny\n access=\nread\n/\n\n\n   \n/interface\n\n\n/node\n\n\n\n\n\norg.allseen.Introspectable Interface\n\n\nTo allow the ability to maintain backwards compatibility with \nDBus, a new Introspection interface was created to allow for \nthe return of descriptions as well as understanding if a \nsignal is sessionless or requires joining a session in order \nto receive the signal.\n\n\nInterface org.allseen.Introspectable\n\n\nThe org.allseen.Introspectable interface provides access to \nthe introspection XML containing the description attributes. \nThe following subsection detail the interface's methods and properties.\n\n\ninterface name=\norg.allseen.Introspectable\n\n   \nmethod name=\nGetDescriptionLanguages\n\n      \narg name=\nlanguageTags\n type=\nas\n direction=\nout\n/\n\n   \n/method\n\n\n   \nmethod name=\nIntrospectWithDescription\n\n      \narg name=\nlanguageTag\n type=\ns\n direction=\nin\n/\n\n      \narg name=\ndata\n type=\ns\n direction=\nout\n/\n\n   \n/method\n\n\n/interface\n\n\n\n\n\nGetDescriptionLanguages\n\n\nReturn the aggregate of the languages for which this object has descriptions.\n\n\nFor example, if an object implements two interfaces, X and Y \n(X has all of its members described in English (en) and French (fr) \nand Y has some descriptions in English (en) and Chinese (cn)), \nthis method returns [\"en\", \"fr\", \"cn\"].\n\n\nNOTE:\n The language tags must comply with IETF language tag standards.\n\n\nIntrospectWithDescription\n\n\nThis method returns the introspection XML with descriptions \nin the specified language (exact match only - no best match).\n\n\nIf an element, such as a method, does not have a description \nin that language, then a language tag determined by the implementer \nof the introspected device will be used. This provides the \nfollowing benefits:\n\n\n\n\nIt allows the ability to provide a \"default\" language so \nthat devices/applications that support Events and Actions \nwill always be visible to a consumer.\n\n\nA device manufacturer can provide a closest language \nalgorithm to adjust the default to a language that is \nclose to the requested one.\n\n\n\n\nFor example, if a device supports English (\"en\") and Spanish (\"es\"), \nand the requested language is Portuguese (\"pt\"), it is better \nto return Spanish as it is Latin-based and may share some common words.\n\n\nNOTE:\n The AllJoyn library does not provide IETF language tag matching logic.\n\n\nSample introspection XML\n\n\nThe following is a sample of the XML that is returned by \nIntrospectWithDescription; it adds the description to the LightOn signal \nwhich creates a LightOn Event.\n\n\nnode\n\n   \ndescription\nYour lightbulb\n/description\n\n\n   \nnode name=\nchild\n\n      \ndescription\nSome helpful description\n/description\n\n   \n/node\n\n\n   \ninterface name=\ncom.example.LightBulb\n\n      \ndescription\nProvides basic lighting functionality\n/description\n\n\n      \nmethod name=\nToggleSwitch\n\n         \ndescription\nInvoke this to toggle whether the light is on or off\n/description\n\n         \narg name=\nbrightess\n type=\ni\n direction=\nin\n\n            \ndescription\nA value to specify how bright the bulb should illuminate\n/description\n\n         \n/arg\n\n      \n/method\n\n\n      \nsignal name=\nLightOn\n sessionless=\ntrue\n\n         \ndescription\nEmitted when the light turns on\n/description\n\n      \n/signal\n\n      \nsignal name=\nLightOff\n sessionless=\ntrue\n\n         \ndescription\nEmitted when the light turns off\n/description\n\n      \n/signal\n\n\n      \nproperty name=\nLightState\n type=\ny\n access=\nread\n\n         \ndescription\nThe current state of this light bulb\n/description\n\n      \n/property\n\n\n   \n/interface\n\n\n/node\n\n\n\n\n\nSetting Descriptions (Standard Core Library)\n\n\nThis section provides usage instructions on the APIs that \nhave been added to the AllJoyn Standard Core Library. \nThese APIs provide the ability to add the introspection \ndescriptions to AllJoyn BusObjects and interfaces. \nThe APIs provide mechanisms for providing these descriptions \nin multiple languages.\n\n\nAPI concepts\n\n\nAs mentioned above, human readable descriptions document \nBusObjects and interfaces hosted by an AllJoyn service framework. \nEach description can be offered in multiple languages \ndenoted with an IETF language tag, for example, \"en\" for English.\n\n\nSet descriptions for a single language\n\n\nTo provide your descriptions in a single language, use the \nAPIs on the BusObject and interfaces to set the description \nand its associated language tag.\n\n\nIn all cases where only a single language is set, this \nstring will be returned to an application that asks for descriptions.\n\n\nSet descriptions for multiple language tags\n\n\nTo provide descriptions in multiple languages provide one or \nmore Translator implementations. The job of the Translator \nis to translate the descriptions set on the BusObjects and \ninterfaces. Translators may be specific on a BusObject or \ninterface, or global in the BusAttachment.\n\n\nWhen generating the introspection XML for each BusObject or \ninterface, the description text is chosen using the following logic:\n\n\n\n\nThe BusObject or interface's own Translator overrides the \nBusAttachment's Translator.\n\n\nA Translator is given priority on providing the translation. \nFor instance, if the BusObject's description is \"Turn on the lights\" \nin \"en\", even if \"en\" is being requested, the XML generator queries \nthe Translator with \"Please translate 'Turn on the lights' \nfrom 'en' to 'en' \". IntrospectWithDescription should always \nreturn a description in some default language if an unrecognized \nlanguage is requested. One method of doing this is for the \nTranslator to return NULL, in which case the BusObject or \nInterfaceDescription's descriptions will be used as the default, \nAlternately, the Translator may return a default language translation. \nMore complex algorithms can provide a similar language match \nso that the end user may have an understanding of the description.\n\n\n\n\nPutting all description texts in a Translator\n\n\nIt is possible to concentrate all descriptions in the \nTranslator implementation by setting the language to the \nempty string, \"\", which has a special meaning. It means \nthat the description in the BusObject or InterfaceDescription \nis not actually a description but rather a \"tag\" or lookup key \nthat is meant to be passed to a Translator.\n\n\nIn this scenario, it is crucial that the Translator return a \ndefault language description even when the language requested \nis not matched. If the Translator returns NULL, no description \nwill be returned.\n\n\nNOTE:\n In this scenario, the description is a lookup tag that \nis never returned in the introspection XML.\n\n\nLinux\n\n\nSetting descriptions in a single language\n\n\nThe easiest way to support descriptions in a single language \nis to set the description texts on the BusObject and \nInterfaceDescription objects. Even though the description \nis only in a single language, the AllJoyn framework still \nneeds to know which language is specified, and the language \nmust be specified in the APIs.\n\n\nBusObject and InterfaceDescription support setting a single \ndescription and its language with the following API methods.\n\n\nvoid BusObject::SetDescription(const char* language, const char* text)\nvoid InterfaceDescription::SetDescriptionLanguage(const char* language)\nvoid InterfaceDescription::SetDescription(const char* description)\n\nQStatus InterfaceDescription::SetMemberDescription(const char* member, \n   const char* description, bool isSessionlessSignal)\nQStatus InterfaceDescription::SetArgDescription(const char* member, \n   const char* arg, const char* description)\nQStatus InterfaceDescription::SetPropertyDescription(const char* name, \n   const char* description)\n\n\n\n\nProviding translations of descriptions\n\n\nDefining a Translator\n\n\nOne way to support descriptions in multiple languages is to \nstart with a single description on the BusObject and InterfaceDescription \nobjects and add a Translator. A Translator is an object that \nimplements the ajn::Translator abstract base class.\n\n\nA Translator class provides the list of languages it can \ntranslate to by implementing the following methods which \nprovide the AllJoyn framework with the ability to iterate \nover the Translator's target languages:\n\n\nsize_t NumTargetLanguages()\nvoid GetTargetLanguage(size_t index, qcc::String\n ret)\n\n\n\n\nIn most cases, a Translator provides translations at runtime using the following:\n\n\nconst char* Translate(const char* sourceLanguage, const char* targetLanguage, \n   const char* source)\n\n\n\n\nThis function should provide a translation of the \"source\" \ntext from \"sourceLanguage\" to \"targetLanguage\". The string \nreturned must be statically allocated, that is, its memory \nmust not be freed at any point.\n\n\nTranslators returning dynamically allocated strings\n\n\nIn special cases where your application needs to return \na string that must be freed at some point after it is used, \nuse this version of the Translate method instead:\n\n\nconst char* Translate(const char* sourceLanguage,\n   const char* targetLanguage, const char* source, qcc::String\n buffer)\n\n\n\n\nThe \"buffer\" parameter of this function should hold the memory \nreturned by the function. The following is an example of how \nto implement this taken from AllJoyn's own code:\n\n\nconst char* JTranslator::Translate(const char* sourceLanguage, \n      const char* targetLanguage,\n      const char* source, qcc::String\n buffer)\n{\n   QCC_DbgPrintf((\nJTranslator::Translate()\n));\n\n      /* ... */\n\n      const char* chars = env-\nGetStringUTFChars(jres, NULL);\n      buffer.assign(chars);\n      env-\nReleaseStringUTFChars(jres, chars);\n\n\n      return buffer.c_str();\n}\n\n\n\n\nSetting the Translator\n\n\nTranslators are set on the BusAttachment, BusObject, or \nInterfaceDescription using the following functions:\n\n\nvoid BusAttachment::SetDescriptionTranslator(Translator* translator)\nvoid BusObject::SetDescriptionTranslator(Translator* translator)\nvoid InterfaceDescription::SetDescriptionTranslator(Translator* translator)\n\n\n\n\nJava\n\n\nSetting descriptions\n\n\nTo set a BusObject's description, specify it when you register the object:\n\n\npublic Status registerBusObject(BusObject busObj,\nString objPath, boolean secure, String languageTag, String description)\n\n\n\n\nTo set descriptions for an interface, use the following annotations:\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nInterface\n\n\nAnnotation type\n\n\nAnnotations\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\norg.alljoyn.bus.annotation\n\n\nBusInterface\n\n\ndescriptionLanguage\n, \ndescription\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nBusMethod\n\n\ndescription\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nBusSignal\n\n\ndescriptionLanguage\n, \ndescription\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nBusProperty\n\n\ndescription\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSetting Translators\n\n\nAs in the Linux binding, Translators may be provided on the \nBusAttachment, BusObject, or Interface levels. The org.alljoyn.bus.Translator \ninterface is equivalent to the Linux ajn::Translator abstract class.\n\n\nTo specify a Translator on the BusAttachment:\n\n\nBusAttachment.setDescriptionTranslator(Translator translator)\n\n\n\n\nTo specify a Translator on the BusObject with the call to BusAttachment.registerBusObject:\n\n\npublic Status registerBusObject(BusObject busObj, String objPath, \nboolean secure, String languageTag, String description,\nTranslator dt)\n\n\n\n\nTo specify a Translator for an Interface, specify its class name \nin the BusInterface descriptionTranslator annotation. \nThe AllJoyn framework instantiates a single instance of the \nTranslator class no matter how many interfaces you specify it on.\n\n\nObjective-C\n\n\nSetting descriptions\n\n\nTo set descriptions on a BusObject, use AJNBusObject's method:\n\n\n- (void)setDescription:(NSString*)description inLanguage:(NSString*)language\n\n\n\n\nTo set descriptions on an Interface, use AJNInterfaceDescription's methods:\n\n\n- (void)setDescriptionLanguage:(NSString *)language;\n\n- (void)setDescription:(NSString *)description;\n- (QStatus)setMemberDescription:(NSString *)description \nforMemberWithName:(NSString*)member sessionlessSignal:(BOOL)sessionless;\n\n- (QStatus)setPropertyDescription:(NSString *)description \nforPropertyWithName:(NSString *)propName;\n\n- (QStatus)setArgDescription:(NSString *)description \nforArgument:(NSString *)argName ofMember:(NSStr ing *)member;\n\n\n\n\nSetting Translators\n\n\nThe AJNTranslator protocol is equivalent to the C++ ajn::Translator \nabstract base class. To set the Translator, the following method \nis supported by AJNBusAttachment, AJNBusObject, and AJNInterfaceDescription:\n\n\n- (void)setDescriptionTranslator:(id\nAJNTranslator\n)translator;\n\n\n\n\nCode generator\n\n\nThe Objective-C code generator supports specifying descriptions \nin the input XML. Since the XML is modeled on the introspection XML, \nsimply specify the descriptions in the same manner they are returned, \nbut with added attributes to define the language of the descriptions. \nThe \ndescription\n element under a \nnode\n or \ninterface\n must contain \na \"language\" attribute.\n\n\nThe following is an example of an XML containing descriptions:\n\n\nxml\n\n   \nnode name=\norg/alljoyn/Bus/sample\n\n      \ndescription language=\nen\nThis is a sample object\n/description\n\n      \nannotation name=\norg.alljoyn.lang.objc\n value=\nSampleObject\n/\n\n         \ninterface name=\norg.alljoyn.bus.sample\n\n            \ndescription language=\nen\nThis is a sample interface\n/description\n\n         \nannotation name=\norg.alljoyn.lang.objc\n value=\nSampleObjectDelegate\n/\n\n\n         \nmethod name=\nConcatenate\n\n            \ndescription\nThis concatenates strings\n/description\n\n            \narg name=\nstr1\n type=\ns\n direction=\nin\n\n               \nannotation name=\norg.alljoyn.lang.objc\n value=\nconcatenateString:\n/\n\n            \n/arg\n\n            \narg name=\nstr2\n type=\ns\n direction=\nin\n\n               \nannotation name=\norg.alljoyn.lang.objc\n value=\nwithString:\n/\n\n            \n/arg\n\n            \narg name=\noutStr\n type=\ns\n direction=\nout\n/\n\n         \n/method\n\n      \n/interface\n\n   \n/node\n\n\n/xml\n\n\n\n\n\nSetting Descriptions (Thin Core Library)\n\n\nThis chapter provides usage instructions on the Thin Core Library \nusage in order to set descriptions on the interfaces so that events \nand actions can be discovered.\n\n\nThin Linux\n\n\nThere are API calls that allow the ability to assign a \ndescription to interface introspection elements. The actual entry \nof the description is table driven, much like the interface creation. \nOne creates a language tag array, a set of strings they \nwish to expose as descriptions, a translate function and \n#defines to lookup the correct strings.\n\n\nAdding descriptions\n\n\nDescriptions can be added to any attribute found in the \nintrospection XML. The following subsection detail the \nability to return descriptions in the Thin Core Library application.\n\n\nCreate arrays for the language tags used\n\n\nDepending on the device being made and the target market \nregions, the developer may wish to support multiple languages. \nIn order to provide this support, create a static array that \ncontains an IETF language tag, for example, \"en\" for English, \n\"es\" for Spanish, etc.\n\n\nstatic const char* const languages[] = { \nen\n, \nes\n };\n\n\n\n\nSet values for encoded descriptions\n\n\nDue to running on a memory-constrained platform, the design \nof providing a description uses an encoding schema. This schema \nis defined as a uint32 broken up into the following values \nthat are compressed into the single uint32 value:\n\n\n\n\nBusObject base ID\n\n\nInterface index\n\n\nMember index\n\n\nArg index\n\n\n\n\nA helper #define named AJ_DESCRIPTION_ID is found in \naj_introspect.h to help encode the messages.\n\n\nFor example, an encoding for the first AJ_Object would be:\n\n\nAJ_DESCRIPTION_ID(SAMPLE_OBJECT_ID, 0, 0, 0)\n\n\n\n\nAn encoding for the first interface in the above object would be:\n\n\nAJ_DESCRIPTION_ID(SAMPLE_OBJECT_ID, 1, 0, 0)\n\n\n\n\nImplement Translator method\n\n\nThe Translator method is a function pointer matching the signature of:\n\n\ntypedef const char* (*AJ_DescriptionLookupFunc)(uint32_t descId, \nconst char* lang);\n\n\n\n\nThis method is invoked on every introspection element and \ngives the app developer the ability to control what string \nis set on which element. The implementation of the Translator \nmethod should always try and return a description if a descId \ncontains descriptions. This allows an application developer to \nreceive and display descriptions when a lang tag of \"\" (empty string) \nor a value that is not contained in the language array are asked for.\n\n\nNOTE:\n An example implementation of a Translator is contained \nin the ajtcl/sample/basic/eventaction_service.c.\n\n\nSet Translator\n\n\nTranslator methods are set per AJ_ObjectList when the AJ_ObjectList \nis registered using the C API AJ_RegisterObjetListWithDescriptions.\n\n\nAJ_ObjectList-specific Translator\n\n\nTo set a specific Translator for an AJ_ObjectList, use the following APIs:\n\n\nAJ_RegisterDescriptionLanguages(const char* const* languages);\nAJ_Status AJ_RegisterObjectListWithDescriptions(const AJ_Object* objList, \nuint8_t index, AJ_DescriptionLookupFunc descLookup);\n\n\n\n\nFirst, set the language array using the AJ_RegisterDescriptionLanguages.\n\n\nNext, register with AllJoyn the AJ_Objects contained in a AJ_ObjectList. \nUse the method AJ_RegisterObjectListWithDescriptions to both register \nthe AJ_Objects and provide the Thin Core Library with the translator \nmethod to invoke when an IntrospectionWithDescriptions call is made \non this ObjectList.\n\n\nModify interface to specify which signals are Sessionless signals\n\n\nThe character ('\n') indicates that a signal will be sent as a \nSessionless signal. When a signal is flagged as such and an \nIntrospectWithDescriptions call is made on the application, \nit appends the attribute of sessionless=true to the signal \nintrospection tag. For example:\n\n\nstatic const char* const sampleInterface[] = { \n   \norg.alljoyn.Bus.eventaction.sample\n,    /* The first entry\n      is the interface name. */\n   \n?dummyMethod foo\ni\n,    /* This is just a dummy entry at index 0 \n   for illustration purposes. */\n   \n?joinMethod inStr1\ns inStr2\ns outStr\ns\n, /* Method at index 1. */ \n   \n!someSignal\n,\n   \n!\nsomeSessionlessSignal\n,\n   NULL\n};\n\n\n\n\nThe interface in the previous example is named org.alljoyn.Bus.eventaction.sample \nand contains the following:\n\n\n\n\nMethods\n\n\ndummyMethod with an input variable of foo\n\n\njoinMethod that accepts two strings and returns a string.\n\n\nSignals\n\n\nsomeSignal that requires a session to receive the signal\n\n\nsomeSessionlessSignal that is sessionless as indicated by the '\n' after the '!'.\n\n\n\n\nAdding '\n' helps applications decide if they can listen in a \npassive way (sessionless) or if they must be connected in a \nsession to receive the signal.\n\n\nRunning the Samples\n\n\nThis section describes how to run the core samples in order \nto test the events and actions feature.\n\n\nEvent picker application for Android\n\n\nAn Application used to find devices that support events and \nactions is provided as an example. This application lists \nthe device name with the set of actions and events that \nthey expose. It also allows the developer the ability to \nset up a rule or select a remote rule engine sample application.\n\n\nBuilding\n\n\nThe Android application requires the use of the Android NDK. \nThis is done due to the AllJoyn Java language binding lacking \nthe ability to dynamically create and interact with AllJoyn interfaces at runtime.\n\n\n\n\nLoad the sample application (cpp/samples/eventaction/Android) into Eclipse.\n\n\n\n\nAdd the Android v4 support library:\n\n\n\n\n\n\nRight-click on the project.\n\n\n\n\nSelect \nAndroid Tools \n Add Support Library...\n.\n\n\n\n\nFollow the prompts to download the support library.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nOpen a Windows command prompt and navigate to the \n/cpp/lib folder.\n\n\n\n\nConnect an Android device to the computer.\n\n\n\n\nExtract the following library files:\n\n\n\n\n\n\nadb pull /system/lib/libcrypto.so\n\n\n\n\n\n\nadb pull /system/lib/libssl.so\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNavigate to the eventaction sample, \n/cpp/samples/eventaction/Android.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nBuild MyAllJoynCode.so using the Android NDK:\n\n\n\n\n\n\nndk-build\n\n\n\n\n\n\nGo back into Eclipse and run the application on your mobile device. \n\n\n\n\n\n\nRight-click on the project.\n\n\n\n\nSelect \nRefresh\n.\n\n\n\n\nRight-click on the project again.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSelect \nRun As \n Android Application\n.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nUsage\n\n\nThe Event Action Browser (EAB) uses the AllJoyn About feature \nto find devices and performs an IntrospectWithDescription request. \nIf any descriptions are found, they display as an Action or Event \nunder the corresponding section.\n\n\nLong pressing on a found item displays more developer \ninformation such as the busName, path, interface, etc.\n\n\nThe EAB further allows for the creation of a rule. Only one \nEvent can be selected and one or more Actions can be selected. \nOnce checked, select \nSave Rule\n. This now causes the EAB to \nlisten for the Signal and make BusMethod calls on the actions.\n\n\nThe application is purely an example and does not allow the \nviewing or deletion of a single rule. Pressing \nDelete Saved\n \nwill clear out the saved instances.\n\n\nIf a remote Sample Rule Application is running, the drop-down \nat the top of the EAB lists the names of the Rule instances. \nThe save and delete functions the same way, only now another \ndevice is going to listen for the Signals and place BusMethod calls.\n\n\nStandard Core Library\n\n\nLinux sample service\n\n\nDescriptions have been added to the sample in alljoyn_core/samples/basic/signal_service.cc.\n\n\nCompile\n\n\nThe sample compiles together with alljoyn_core.\n\n\nRun\n\n\nRun the application at the following location:\n\n\nbuild/\nos\n/\ncpu\n/\ndebug|release\n/dist/cpp/bin/samples/signal_service\n\n\n\n\nJava sample service\n\n\nSample service and client applications can be found at the following locations:\n\n\n\n\nsamples/java/JavaSDKDoc/JavaSDKDocIntrospectWithDescriptionService/\n\n\nsamples/java/JavaSDKDoc/JavaSDKDocIntrospectWithDescriptionClient\n\n\n\n\nCompile\n\n\nThe samples compile together with alljoyn_java.\n\n\nRun\n\n\nTo run the service: \n\n\njava -jar\nbuild/\nos\n/\ncpu\n/\ndebug|release\n/dist/java/jar/JavaSDKDocIntrospectWithDescriptionService.jar\n\n\n\n\nTo run the client: \n\n\njava -jar\nbuild/\nos\n/\ncpu\n/\ndebug|release\n/dist/java/jar/JavaSDKDocIntrospectWithDescriptionClient.jar\n\n\n\n\nThin Core Library\n\n\nCompile\n\n\n\n\nNavigate to the ajtcl folder.\n\n\nType \nscons\n to build on the platform.\n\n\n\n\nRun\n\n\nThe eventaction_service application executable is found \nunder ajtcl/samples/basic/. Run this application to exercise \nthe ability to offer descriptions when an IntrospectionWithDescriptions \ncall is made.\n\n\n$ ./samples/basic/eventaction_service\n\n\n\n\nBest Practices and Common Issues\n\n\nWhat should a Translator method do?\n\n\nThe Translator method should always return a human readable \nstring regardless of the asked for language. This allows \nfor an end user to always discover the Event and Action \ndescriptions to be shown in a UI.\n\n\nThe Translator should first try and match the requested \nlanguage tag to one that is supported and return the correct \nstring. At a minimum, if the language tag does not match it \nshould return a string in a default language. The default \nlanguage is up to the creator of the device to determine.\n\n\nWhen to use Events and Actions?\n\n\nThe power of the Events and Actions feature is that a small \nchange helps enable an end consumer to connect applications \ntogether in new ways. When a device supports certain features \nand functions that are interesting, they should be considered \nas being expressed as an Event or Action\n\n\nFor example, a talking teddy bear can have a series of phrases \nthat can be spoken. The bear by itself can say things like \n\"Good morning\", etc. By simply creating the ability for \nGoodMorning to be expressed as an Action with a description \nof \"Say Good Morning\", the bear can now be connected to \nother devices. When a consumer has a smart alarm clock, \nthe clock can be connected to have the bear speak the \n\"Good Morning\" greeting to wake them up.\n\n\nMost devices/applications have a set of defined features. \nTo allow for greater reach and interactions, these features \nshould be evaluated to understand if a simple presentation \nto an end user creates a larger experience with other devices.\n\n\nShould I introspect everything?\n\n\nSince any device can contain events or actions, it should \nbe introspected to check for these. However, it is recommended \nfirst to use the GetDescriptionLanguages API call to do the following:\n\n\n\n\nCheck that the \"org.allseen.Introspectable\" interface is present.\n\n\nEnsure that the language tag exists that matches what the \nconsumer has set on a mobile device.\n\n\n\n\nIf the language tag does not match, a pop-up or feedback to \nthe user can ask the user what language they would like descriptions \nin, else the default language will be returned. If GetDescriptionLanguages \nreturns an error, this means that the device has no events or \nactions and should not be introspected again.\n\n\nWhen the introspection with descriptions is made, a commercial \nquality application should store the object path and device \ninformation so that only an introspection request on specific \nobjects on devices can be made in the future. This allows for \nless traffic over the network\n\n\nWhich language tag is used when introspecting?\n\n\nIt is recommended to use the GetDescriptionLanguages API so \nthat the consumer knows in advance what language will show up \nfrom the device. Since Events and Actions really revolve around \nthe end consumer, it is important to provide them with information \nthat makes sense. It is best to use the language from the device \nsettings, however, the application may want to present a user \nwith a list of languages to pick from.\n\n\nAs a failsafe, if a device is introspected with an invalid tag, \nit should return a default description. Per the information in \n\nWhat should a Translator method do?\n, \na device or application should always return a description \nthat can be rendered in a UI for a consumer to link events and actions.\n\n\nCan the Rule engine be used as is?\n\n\nThe sample rule engine is very primitive and sets up a link \nbetween devices. In the AllJoyn SDK, the rule engine is currently \ncontained in both an Android application and as a standalone \nprocess. In the sample rule engine, the linkage between and \nevent and action (rule) is not long-lasting. When an application/device \npowers on and connects to the AllJoyn network, it changes the \nbusName. This means that the saved information in the rule is \nno longer valid. A commercial quality Rule Engine saves off \nthe DeviceId and ApplicationId from the About Announcement, \nand then updates the saved busName with what was received \nin the About Announcement. This allows for devices to be \npowered off and come back on later and have the rules still apply.\n\n\nThe sample rule engine also does not provide the ability to \nlist the saved rules or edit rules. This is something that \nis out of scope for the sample application.\n\n\nAs a standalone rule engine, the communication to the Android \nsample is through an AllJoyn interface and is done as a sample, \nnot a final solution.",

Interface structure  AllJoyn interfaces are defined as XML and contain specific tags \nthat represent the definition expressed.

NOTE:  The language tags must comply with IETF language tag standards.  IntrospectWithDescription  This method returns the introspection XML with descriptions \nin the specified language (exact match only - no best match).  If an element, such as a method, does not have a description \nin that language, then a language tag determined by the implementer \nof the introspected device will be used. This provides the \nfollowing benefits:   It allows the ability to provide a \"default\" language so \nthat devices/applications that support Events and Actions \nwill always be visible to a consumer.  A device manufacturer can provide a closest language \nalgorithm to adjust the default to a language that is \nclose to the requested one.   For example, if a device supports English (\"en\") and Spanish (\"es\"), \nand the requested language is Portuguese (\"pt\"), it is better \nto return Spanish as it is Latin-based and may share some common words.

            "text": "This section provides usage instructions on the APIs that \nhave been added to the AllJoyn Standard Core Library. \nThese APIs provide the ability to add the introspection \ndescriptions to AllJoyn BusObjects and interfaces. \nThe APIs provide mechanisms for providing these descriptions \nin multiple languages.  API concepts  As mentioned above, human readable descriptions document \nBusObjects and interfaces hosted by an AllJoyn service framework. \nEach description can be offered in multiple languages \ndenoted with an IETF language tag, for example, \"en\" for English.  Set descriptions for a single language  To provide your descriptions in a single language, use the \nAPIs on the BusObject and interfaces to set the description \nand its associated language tag.  In all cases where only a single language is set, this \nstring will be returned to an application that asks for descriptions.  Set descriptions for multiple language tags  To provide descriptions in multiple languages provide one or \nmore Translator implementations. The job of the Translator \nis to translate the descriptions set on the BusObjects and \ninterfaces. Translators may be specific on a BusObject or \ninterface, or global in the BusAttachment.  When generating the introspection XML for each BusObject or \ninterface, the description text is chosen using the following logic:   The BusObject or interface's own Translator overrides the \nBusAttachment's Translator.  A Translator is given priority on providing the translation. \nFor instance, if the BusObject's description is \"Turn on the lights\" \nin \"en\", even if \"en\" is being requested, the XML generator queries \nthe Translator with \"Please translate 'Turn on the lights' \nfrom 'en' to 'en' \". IntrospectWithDescription should always \nreturn a description in some default language if an unrecognized \nlanguage is requested. One method of doing this is for the \nTranslator to return NULL, in which case the BusObject or \nInterfaceDescription's descriptions will be used as the default, \nAlternately, the Translator may return a default language translation. \nMore complex algorithms can provide a similar language match \nso that the end user may have an understanding of the description.   Putting all description texts in a Translator  It is possible to concentrate all descriptions in the \nTranslator implementation by setting the language to the \nempty string, \"\", which has a special meaning. It means \nthat the description in the BusObject or InterfaceDescription \nis not actually a description but rather a \"tag\" or lookup key \nthat is meant to be passed to a Translator.  In this scenario, it is crucial that the Translator return a \ndefault language description even when the language requested \nis not matched. If the Translator returns NULL, no description \nwill be returned.  NOTE:  In this scenario, the description is a lookup tag that \nis never returned in the introspection XML.  Linux  Setting descriptions in a single language  The easiest way to support descriptions in a single language \nis to set the description texts on the BusObject and \nInterfaceDescription objects. Even though the description \nis only in a single language, the AllJoyn framework still \nneeds to know which language is specified, and the language \nmust be specified in the APIs.  BusObject and InterfaceDescription support setting a single \ndescription and its language with the following API methods.  void BusObject::SetDescription(const char* language, const char* text)\nvoid InterfaceDescription::SetDescriptionLanguage(const char* language)\nvoid InterfaceDescription::SetDescription(const char* description)\n\nQStatus InterfaceDescription::SetMemberDescription(const char* member, \n   const char* description, bool isSessionlessSignal)\nQStatus InterfaceDescription::SetArgDescription(const char* member, \n   const char* arg, const char* description)\nQStatus InterfaceDescription::SetPropertyDescription(const char* name, \n   const char* description)  Providing translations of descriptions  Defining a Translator  One way to support descriptions in multiple languages is to \nstart with a single description on the BusObject and InterfaceDescription \nobjects and add a Translator. A Translator is an object that \nimplements the ajn::Translator abstract base class.  A Translator class provides the list of languages it can \ntranslate to by implementing the following methods which \nprovide the AllJoyn framework with the ability to iterate \nover the Translator's target languages:  size_t NumTargetLanguages()\nvoid GetTargetLanguage(size_t index, qcc::String  ret)  In most cases, a Translator provides translations at runtime using the following:  const char* Translate(const char* sourceLanguage, const char* targetLanguage, \n   const char* source)  This function should provide a translation of the \"source\" \ntext from \"sourceLanguage\" to \"targetLanguage\". The string \nreturned must be statically allocated, that is, its memory \nmust not be freed at any point.  Translators returning dynamically allocated strings  In special cases where your application needs to return \na string that must be freed at some point after it is used, \nuse this version of the Translate method instead:  const char* Translate(const char* sourceLanguage,\n   const char* targetLanguage, const char* source, qcc::String  buffer)  The \"buffer\" parameter of this function should hold the memory \nreturned by the function. The following is an example of how \nto implement this taken from AllJoyn's own code:  const char* JTranslator::Translate(const char* sourceLanguage, \n      const char* targetLanguage,\n      const char* source, qcc::String  buffer)\n{\n   QCC_DbgPrintf(( JTranslator::Translate() ));\n\n      /* ... */\n\n      const char* chars = env- GetStringUTFChars(jres, NULL);\n      buffer.assign(chars);\n      env- ReleaseStringUTFChars(jres, chars);\n\n\n      return buffer.c_str();\n}  Setting the Translator  Translators are set on the BusAttachment, BusObject, or \nInterfaceDescription using the following functions:  void BusAttachment::SetDescriptionTranslator(Translator* translator)\nvoid BusObject::SetDescriptionTranslator(Translator* translator)\nvoid InterfaceDescription::SetDescriptionTranslator(Translator* translator)  Java  Setting descriptions  To set a BusObject's description, specify it when you register the object:  public Status registerBusObject(BusObject busObj,\nString objPath, boolean secure, String languageTag, String description)  To set descriptions for an interface, use the following annotations:     Interface  Annotation type  Annotations      org.alljoyn.bus.annotation  BusInterface  descriptionLanguage ,  description     BusMethod  description     BusSignal  descriptionLanguage ,  description     BusProperty  description     Setting Translators  As in the Linux binding, Translators may be provided on the \nBusAttachment, BusObject, or Interface levels. The org.alljoyn.bus.Translator \ninterface is equivalent to the Linux ajn::Translator abstract class.  To specify a Translator on the BusAttachment:  BusAttachment.setDescriptionTranslator(Translator translator)  To specify a Translator on the BusObject with the call to BusAttachment.registerBusObject:  public Status registerBusObject(BusObject busObj, String objPath, \nboolean secure, String languageTag, String description,\nTranslator dt)  To specify a Translator for an Interface, specify its class name \nin the BusInterface descriptionTranslator annotation. \nThe AllJoyn framework instantiates a single instance of the \nTranslator class no matter how many interfaces you specify it on.  Objective-C  Setting descriptions  To set descriptions on a BusObject, use AJNBusObject's method:  - (void)setDescription:(NSString*)description inLanguage:(NSString*)language  To set descriptions on an Interface, use AJNInterfaceDescription's methods:  - (void)setDescriptionLanguage:(NSString *)language;\n\n- (void)setDescription:(NSString *)description;\n- (QStatus)setMemberDescription:(NSString *)description \nforMemberWithName:(NSString*)member sessionlessSignal:(BOOL)sessionless;\n\n- (QStatus)setPropertyDescription:(NSString *)description \nforPropertyWithName:(NSString *)propName;\n\n- (QStatus)setArgDescription:(NSString *)description \nforArgument:(NSString *)argName ofMember:(NSStr ing *)member;  Setting Translators  The AJNTranslator protocol is equivalent to the C++ ajn::Translator \nabstract base class. To set the Translator, the following method \nis supported by AJNBusAttachment, AJNBusObject, and AJNInterfaceDescription:  - (void)setDescriptionTranslator:(id AJNTranslator )translator;  Code generator  The Objective-C code generator supports specifying descriptions \nin the input XML. Since the XML is modeled on the introspection XML, \nsimply specify the descriptions in the same manner they are returned, \nbut with added attributes to define the language of the descriptions. \nThe  description  element under a  node  or  interface  must contain \na \"language\" attribute.  The following is an example of an XML containing descriptions:  xml \n    node name= org/alljoyn/Bus/sample \n       description language= en This is a sample object /description \n       annotation name= org.alljoyn.lang.objc  value= SampleObject / \n          interface name= org.alljoyn.bus.sample \n             description language= en This is a sample interface /description \n          annotation name= org.alljoyn.lang.objc  value= SampleObjectDelegate / \n\n          method name= Concatenate \n             description This concatenates strings /description \n             arg name= str1  type= s  direction= in \n                annotation name= org.alljoyn.lang.objc  value= concatenateString: / \n             /arg \n             arg name= str2  type= s  direction= in \n                annotation name= org.alljoyn.lang.objc  value= withString: / \n             /arg \n             arg name= outStr  type= s  direction= out / \n          /method \n       /interface \n    /node  /xml",

            "text": "This chapter provides usage instructions on the Thin Core Library \nusage in order to set descriptions on the interfaces so that events \nand actions can be discovered.  Thin Linux  There are API calls that allow the ability to assign a \ndescription to interface introspection elements. The actual entry \nof the description is table driven, much like the interface creation. \nOne creates a language tag array, a set of strings they \nwish to expose as descriptions, a translate function and \n#defines to lookup the correct strings.  Adding descriptions  Descriptions can be added to any attribute found in the \nintrospection XML. The following subsection detail the \nability to return descriptions in the Thin Core Library application.  Create arrays for the language tags used  Depending on the device being made and the target market \nregions, the developer may wish to support multiple languages. \nIn order to provide this support, create a static array that \ncontains an IETF language tag, for example, \"en\" for English, \n\"es\" for Spanish, etc.  static const char* const languages[] = {  en ,  es  };  Set values for encoded descriptions  Due to running on a memory-constrained platform, the design \nof providing a description uses an encoding schema. This schema \nis defined as a uint32 broken up into the following values \nthat are compressed into the single uint32 value:   BusObject base ID  Interface index  Member index  Arg index   A helper #define named AJ_DESCRIPTION_ID is found in \naj_introspect.h to help encode the messages.  For example, an encoding for the first AJ_Object would be:  AJ_DESCRIPTION_ID(SAMPLE_OBJECT_ID, 0, 0, 0)  An encoding for the first interface in the above object would be:  AJ_DESCRIPTION_ID(SAMPLE_OBJECT_ID, 1, 0, 0)  Implement Translator method  The Translator method is a function pointer matching the signature of:  typedef const char* (*AJ_DescriptionLookupFunc)(uint32_t descId, \nconst char* lang);  This method is invoked on every introspection element and \ngives the app developer the ability to control what string \nis set on which element. The implementation of the Translator \nmethod should always try and return a description if a descId \ncontains descriptions. This allows an application developer to \nreceive and display descriptions when a lang tag of \"\" (empty string) \nor a value that is not contained in the language array are asked for.  NOTE:  An example implementation of a Translator is contained \nin the ajtcl/sample/basic/eventaction_service.c.  Set Translator  Translator methods are set per AJ_ObjectList when the AJ_ObjectList \nis registered using the C API AJ_RegisterObjetListWithDescriptions.  AJ_ObjectList-specific Translator  To set a specific Translator for an AJ_ObjectList, use the following APIs:  AJ_RegisterDescriptionLanguages(const char* const* languages);\nAJ_Status AJ_RegisterObjectListWithDescriptions(const AJ_Object* objList, \nuint8_t index, AJ_DescriptionLookupFunc descLookup);  First, set the language array using the AJ_RegisterDescriptionLanguages.  Next, register with AllJoyn the AJ_Objects contained in a AJ_ObjectList. \nUse the method AJ_RegisterObjectListWithDescriptions to both register \nthe AJ_Objects and provide the Thin Core Library with the translator \nmethod to invoke when an IntrospectionWithDescriptions call is made \non this ObjectList.  Modify interface to specify which signals are Sessionless signals  The character (' ') indicates that a signal will be sent as a \nSessionless signal. When a signal is flagged as such and an \nIntrospectWithDescriptions call is made on the application, \nit appends the attribute of sessionless=true to the signal \nintrospection tag. For example:  static const char* const sampleInterface[] = { \n    org.alljoyn.Bus.eventaction.sample ,    /* The first entry\n      is the interface name. */\n    ?dummyMethod foo i ,    /* This is just a dummy entry at index 0 \n   for illustration purposes. */\n    ?joinMethod inStr1 s inStr2 s outStr s , /* Method at index 1. */ \n    !someSignal ,\n    ! someSessionlessSignal ,\n   NULL\n};  The interface in the previous example is named org.alljoyn.Bus.eventaction.sample \nand contains the following:   Methods  dummyMethod with an input variable of foo  joinMethod that accepts two strings and returns a string.  Signals  someSignal that requires a session to receive the signal  someSessionlessSignal that is sessionless as indicated by the ' ' after the '!'.   Adding ' ' helps applications decide if they can listen in a \npassive way (sessionless) or if they must be connected in a \nsession to receive the signal.",

            "text": "This section describes how to run the core samples in order \nto test the events and actions feature.  Event picker application for Android  An Application used to find devices that support events and \nactions is provided as an example. This application lists \nthe device name with the set of actions and events that \nthey expose. It also allows the developer the ability to \nset up a rule or select a remote rule engine sample application.  Building  The Android application requires the use of the Android NDK. \nThis is done due to the AllJoyn Java language binding lacking \nthe ability to dynamically create and interact with AllJoyn interfaces at runtime.   Load the sample application (cpp/samples/eventaction/Android) into Eclipse.   Add the Android v4 support library:    Right-click on the project.   Select  Android Tools   Add Support Library... .   Follow the prompts to download the support library.    Open a Windows command prompt and navigate to the  /cpp/lib folder.   Connect an Android device to the computer.   Extract the following library files:    adb pull /system/lib/libcrypto.so    adb pull /system/lib/libssl.so    Navigate to the eventaction sample,  /cpp/samples/eventaction/Android.    Build MyAllJoynCode.so using the Android NDK:    ndk-build    Go back into Eclipse and run the application on your mobile device.     Right-click on the project.   Select  Refresh .   Right-click on the project again.    Select  Run As   Android Application .    Usage  The Event Action Browser (EAB) uses the AllJoyn About feature \nto find devices and performs an IntrospectWithDescription request. \nIf any descriptions are found, they display as an Action or Event \nunder the corresponding section.  Long pressing on a found item displays more developer \ninformation such as the busName, path, interface, etc.  The EAB further allows for the creation of a rule. Only one \nEvent can be selected and one or more Actions can be selected. \nOnce checked, select  Save Rule . This now causes the EAB to \nlisten for the Signal and make BusMethod calls on the actions.  The application is purely an example and does not allow the \nviewing or deletion of a single rule. Pressing  Delete Saved  \nwill clear out the saved instances.  If a remote Sample Rule Application is running, the drop-down \nat the top of the EAB lists the names of the Rule instances. \nThe save and delete functions the same way, only now another \ndevice is going to listen for the Signals and place BusMethod calls.

            "text": "What should a Translator method do?  The Translator method should always return a human readable \nstring regardless of the asked for language. This allows \nfor an end user to always discover the Event and Action \ndescriptions to be shown in a UI.  The Translator should first try and match the requested \nlanguage tag to one that is supported and return the correct \nstring. At a minimum, if the language tag does not match it \nshould return a string in a default language. The default \nlanguage is up to the creator of the device to determine.  When to use Events and Actions?  The power of the Events and Actions feature is that a small \nchange helps enable an end consumer to connect applications \ntogether in new ways. When a device supports certain features \nand functions that are interesting, they should be considered \nas being expressed as an Event or Action  For example, a talking teddy bear can have a series of phrases \nthat can be spoken. The bear by itself can say things like \n\"Good morning\", etc. By simply creating the ability for \nGoodMorning to be expressed as an Action with a description \nof \"Say Good Morning\", the bear can now be connected to \nother devices. When a consumer has a smart alarm clock, \nthe clock can be connected to have the bear speak the \n\"Good Morning\" greeting to wake them up.  Most devices/applications have a set of defined features. \nTo allow for greater reach and interactions, these features \nshould be evaluated to understand if a simple presentation \nto an end user creates a larger experience with other devices.  Should I introspect everything?  Since any device can contain events or actions, it should \nbe introspected to check for these. However, it is recommended \nfirst to use the GetDescriptionLanguages API call to do the following:   Check that the \"org.allseen.Introspectable\" interface is present.  Ensure that the language tag exists that matches what the \nconsumer has set on a mobile device.   If the language tag does not match, a pop-up or feedback to \nthe user can ask the user what language they would like descriptions \nin, else the default language will be returned. If GetDescriptionLanguages \nreturns an error, this means that the device has no events or \nactions and should not be introspected again.  When the introspection with descriptions is made, a commercial \nquality application should store the object path and device \ninformation so that only an introspection request on specific \nobjects on devices can be made in the future. This allows for \nless traffic over the network  Which language tag is used when introspecting?  It is recommended to use the GetDescriptionLanguages API so \nthat the consumer knows in advance what language will show up \nfrom the device. Since Events and Actions really revolve around \nthe end consumer, it is important to provide them with information \nthat makes sense. It is best to use the language from the device \nsettings, however, the application may want to present a user \nwith a list of languages to pick from.  As a failsafe, if a device is introspected with an invalid tag, \nit should return a default description. Per the information in  What should a Translator method do? , \na device or application should always return a description \nthat can be rendered in a UI for a consumer to link events and actions.  Can the Rule engine be used as is?  The sample rule engine is very primitive and sets up a link \nbetween devices. In the AllJoyn SDK, the rule engine is currently \ncontained in both an Android application and as a standalone \nprocess. In the sample rule engine, the linkage between and \nevent and action (rule) is not long-lasting. When an application/device \npowers on and connects to the AllJoyn network, it changes the \nbusName. This means that the saved information in the rule is \nno longer valid. A commercial quality Rule Engine saves off \nthe DeviceId and ApplicationId from the About Announcement, \nand then updates the saved busName with what was received \nin the About Announcement. This allows for devices to be \npowered off and come back on later and have the rules still apply.  The sample rule engine also does not provide the ability to \nlist the saved rules or edit rules. This is something that \nis out of scope for the sample application.  As a standalone rule engine, the communication to the Android \nsample is through an AllJoyn interface and is done as a sample, \nnot a final solution.",

Any notification\nyou send must include the notification content, message type,\nand TTL for the message.  You can optionally provide a pointer to the serial number\nthat will be updated with the outgoing AllJoyn signal's message\nserial number.

You will need the serial number if you wish to later cancel\nthe notification prior to the TTL expiry using the CancelNotification API.   Delete the last notification message  Once a notification was sent out and the application writer\nwould like to cancel it before the TTL expiration, for example,\nif the notification was sent for an event that no longer occurs,\nuse the DeleteLastNotification API to delete the last notification\nfor a given message type.  AJNS_Producer_DeleteLastNotification( busAttachment, messageType);  Cancel a specific notification message  An alternative to deleting the last notification message for\na particular message type is to cancel a specific notification\nmessage by its serial number that was returned by the  SendNotification \ncall.Use the CancelNotification API to do so.

The notification will support multiple\nlanguages so that the correct language of the platform can\nbe used; this avoids translating strings to be displayed.\nAs such, it is important for the manufacturer of the software\nrunning on the Notification Producer side to send the correct\ntranslations for the languages that are supported.\n\n\nMachine-to-machine use case\n\n\nThe notification text entries should never be used for any\nother purpose than providing a human-readable message.\nA notification message, by design, will be received and\nshown by any application to convey a meaning relevant to the\nsending device.\n\n\nAn application making use of the Notification service framework\nshould never assume that a specific application designed to be\nthe Notification Consumer side is the only instance in the\nproximal network. Again, every message will travel to all\nNofication Consumer applications to be displayed.\n\n\nWhen to send an Emergency notification\n\n\nA notification supports the following message types:\n\n\n\n\nInformation\n\n\nWarning\n\n\nEmergency\n\n\n\n\nUse the Emergency message type only when something very important\nmust be relayed to the consumer. For example, a notification\nabout a social media-related update should have a message type\nof Information, while a notification about an appliance malfunction\nor a security system being triggered warrants the message type of Emergency.\n\n\nSince a notification trigger uses UDP multicast, resulting in\nunreliable delivery, an Emergency notification should send\nmultiple times, possibly until it can be verified that a user\nhas received it and taken action.\n\n\nNOTE:\n Use common sense when setting the message type. Consumers\nshould not receive numerous messages other than those specified\nas an emergency notification. This is to avoid a person seeing\na message like \"The sky is blue\" 8 times when it does not\nrequire an immediate action or response.\n\n\nWhat is the purpose of rich notification media?\n\n\nBesides the text payload, a notification can contain an icon\nand audio data. A television or other device with audio output\ncapabilities can leverage the Notification service framework\nas a consumer. Audio content can contain a text-to-speech\nversion of the notification message text, thereby allowing\nthe end user to both view and hear the notification contents.\nAnother use case involves a consumer that does not have visual\ndisplay capabilities, such as a wireless speaker. In that case,\na notification can be audibly conveyed to the user. An icon\ncan be used to show some aspect of the notification, such as\nthe producer it was sent from, or the content it contains.\nAs an example, consider a coffee maker that sends a notification\nwhen it is done brewing. An icon can be used to represent\nthe type of coffee that was selected, such as regular, strong, or decaf.\n\n\nNOTE:\n The icon and audio data are not contained within the\nactual notification. Instead, an AllJoyn\n object path is used\nto obtain the icon or audio content that is sent as part of\nthe notification. See the Notification API Guide listed at\nthe top of this page for the platform you are targeting for\ndetails on using this capability.\n\n\nCan I have more than 1 response action?\n\n\nThe current Notification service framework release supports\nonly one response action; however, this may change in future\nupdates. Notifications are informative and designed to be\nnonintrusive to a user. If more actions are needed, the\nresponse action should be to launch a separate application\nthat provides the user with more options and greater ability\nto interact with the Producer application/device.\n\n\nHow to use the TTL on a producer\n\n\nThe time to live (TTL) of a notification message defines the\nvalidity period of the message. A notification message can\nbe received by a consumer that connects to the same network\nas the producer that sent the message during the defined TTL\nperiod. See the \nNotification Interface Definition\n\nfor more information on this behavior and timelines of specific use cases.\n\n\nAs a general rule, the TTL for a notification should be set to correspond\nwith the type of information included in the notification. For example,\nif the notification contains information that is no longer valid or\nuseful after 5 minutes, the TTL should be set to 5 minutes.\n\n\nNOTE:\n The TTL is not sent as part of the actual notification\npayload, and is instead used by the Notification service internally\n\n\nUI considerations\n\n\nHow long to show the notification\n\n\nThe length of time to show a notification should be consistent\nwith the following criteria:\n\n\n\n\nBehavior of the platform/application the notification is\nbeing displayed on\n\n\nMessage type (Information, Warning, Emergency)\n\n\nAny preferences the user has set to view notifications.\n\n\n\n\nFor example, on an Android platform application, an Information\nnotification can be shown with a short Toast (overlay message\nthat is temporarily displayed), while a Warning notification\ncan be shown with a long Toast. Additionally, the display of\nnotifications can be integrated into the existing Android\nNotification system to provide for a consistent user experience.\nRefer to the NotificationServiceUISample application for example code.\n\n\nHow to handle a notification with response\n\n\nA notification includes an optional field where the path of\nan AllJoyn BusObject can be specified. This feature is used\nwith notifications where a response, such as a yes or no confirmation,\nis associated with the notification and used to interact with the\nproducer that sent the notification. From a UI standpoint, the\nnotification should include a button whose onclick action will\ninvoke the method on the supplied BusObject path.\n\n\nFor example, the user can receive a notification from a smart\ncoffee maker that has been on for an hour and not used. The\nnotification can include text that gives the user the option\nto turn off the coffee maker, and response options of yes\nor no are presented to the user accompanying the notification\ntext. Clicking on \"yes\" would invoke an AllJoyn BusMethod on\nthe coffee machine to turn off the appliance; \"no\" would dismiss\nthe notification.\n\n\nHandling first time notification from a new appliance\n\n\nBy definition, a notification is sent to all Consumer applications\nconnected to a network. Because the Consumer application is running\non a TV or other device that a user is constantly viewing, it is\nimportant to filter the notifications on the appliance/device (consumer).\n\n\nIt is recommended that when the first notification is received\nby a consumer from an appliance/device, a UI is presented to\nthe user prompting the user to configure the consumer application:\n\n\n\n\nHow to receive notifications\n\n\nWhat priority of notifications should be shown\n\n\n\n\nThe UI should follow the example that is shown in the sample\napplications contained with the Notification service framework.",

Google has detailed\ninstructions for downloading and building Android source.\n\n\nFor a list of system requirements and instructions for obtaining\nthe required tools, see http://source.android.com/source/initializing.html\n\n\nFor instructions on obtaining the Android Source Tree,\nsee http://source.android.com/source/downloading.html\n\n\nWhen running the repo init command specify the branch name for\nthe Android release you are targeting. Branch names are listed at\nhttp://source.android.com/source/build-numbers.html#source-code-tags-and-builds\n\n\nFor instructions on building and running the build source, see\nhttp://source.android.com/source/building.html\n\n\n\n\nBuild the \"generic\" version of Android.\n\n\nThere is no need to run the code. Only the build libraries\nthat are not available in the NDK are used.\n\n\n\n\nObtaining the AllJoyn source\n\n\nIf you followed the instructions in \nThe Android source\n,\nyou should have the repo tool and git installed on your system.\nEnter the following commands to get the AllJoyn source:\n\n\n$ mkdir $HOME/alljoyn # for example\n$ cd $HOME/alljoyn\n$ repo init -u git://github.com/alljoyn/manifest.git\n$ repo sync\n$ repo start master --all\n\n\n\n\nBuilding the AllJoyn framework for Android\n\n\nAt this point. you have all of the files and programs required\nto build the AllJoyn framework for Android. The following commands assume\nyou have installed the Android NDK at \n/usr/local/android-ndk-r9d\n,\nyou have downloaded and built the Android source, and it is\nlocated in \n$HOME/android-platform\n.\n\n\nUse the following commands to build the AllJoyn framework for Android using\nbuiltin crypto:\n\n\n$ export JAVA_HOME=\n/usr/lib/jvm/java-6-sun\n # or java-5-sun\n$ export CLASSPATH=\n/usr/share/java/junit.jar\n\n$ scons OS=android CPU=arm CRYPTO=builtin ANDROID_NDK=/usr/local/android-ndk-r9b\n   ANDROID_SRC=$HOME/android-platform WS=off\n\n\n\n\nTo build using OpenSSL crypto functions:\n\n\n$ export JAVA_HOME=\n/usr/lib/jvm/java-6-sun\n # or java-5-sun\n$ export CLASSPATH=\n/usr/share/java/junit.jar\n\n$ scons OS=android CPU=arm CRYPTO=openssl ANDROID_NDK=/usr/local/android-ndk-r9b\n   ANDROID_SRC=$HOME/android-platform WS=off\n\n\n\n\nIt is possible to specify that the AllJoyn framework uses\nadditional tools during the build process. For example, the\nAllJoyn framework can use Uncrustify to check white space\ncompliance and Doxygen for producing API documentation for\nthe C++ APIs. See \nConfiguring the Build Environment (Linux Platform)\n\nfor detailed instructions for installing these two tools.",

To compile AllJoyn from source, the following items are required:   Android SDK  Android NDK  An Android IDE  Android source   Instructions for obtaining the Android SDK, Android NDK, and IDEs\nare in  Setting Up the Programming Environment .  The Android source  The Android source (http://source.android.com) is required\nfor building Android targets using OpenSSL. Google has detailed\ninstructions for downloading and building Android source.  For a list of system requirements and instructions for obtaining\nthe required tools, see http://source.android.com/source/initializing.html  For instructions on obtaining the Android Source Tree,\nsee http://source.android.com/source/downloading.html  When running the repo init command specify the branch name for\nthe Android release you are targeting. Branch names are listed at\nhttp://source.android.com/source/build-numbers.html#source-code-tags-and-builds  For instructions on building and running the build source, see\nhttp://source.android.com/source/building.html   Build the \"generic\" version of Android.  There is no need to run the code. Only the build libraries\nthat are not available in the NDK are used.   Obtaining the AllJoyn source  If you followed the instructions in  The Android source ,\nyou should have the repo tool and git installed on your system.\nEnter the following commands to get the AllJoyn source:  $ mkdir $HOME/alljoyn # for example\n$ cd $HOME/alljoyn\n$ repo init -u git://github.com/alljoyn/manifest.git\n$ repo sync\n$ repo start master --all  Building the AllJoyn framework for Android  At this point. you have all of the files and programs required\nto build the AllJoyn framework for Android. The following commands assume\nyou have installed the Android NDK at  /usr/local/android-ndk-r9d ,\nyou have downloaded and built the Android source, and it is\nlocated in  $HOME/android-platform .  Use the following commands to build the AllJoyn framework for Android using\nbuiltin crypto:  $ export JAVA_HOME= /usr/lib/jvm/java-6-sun  # or java-5-sun\n$ export CLASSPATH= /usr/share/java/junit.jar \n$ scons OS=android CPU=arm CRYPTO=builtin ANDROID_NDK=/usr/local/android-ndk-r9b\n   ANDROID_SRC=$HOME/android-platform WS=off  To build using OpenSSL crypto functions:  $ export JAVA_HOME= /usr/lib/jvm/java-6-sun  # or java-5-sun\n$ export CLASSPATH= /usr/share/java/junit.jar \n$ scons OS=android CPU=arm CRYPTO=openssl ANDROID_NDK=/usr/local/android-ndk-r9b\n   ANDROID_SRC=$HOME/android-platform WS=off  It is possible to specify that the AllJoyn framework uses\nadditional tools during the build process. For example, the\nAllJoyn framework can use Uncrustify to check white space\ncompliance and Doxygen for producing API documentation for\nthe C++ APIs. See  Configuring the Build Environment (Linux Platform) \nfor detailed instructions for installing these two tools.",

The router can be in standalone or bundled form.\n\n\n\n\nIs the access point conducive to a peer-to-peer network?\n\n\n\n\nFor the AllJoyn framework to work on a Wi-Fi network, it should \n  have multi-cast packet routing enabled and wireless isolation turned off. \n  The AllJoyn framework handles the case of wireless isolation if \n  you do not care which transport is used, but if you want strictly \n  Wi-Fi access, wireless isolation should be turned off.\n\n\nCheck for \nAndroidManifest.xml\n.\n\n\n\n\nThe \nAndroidManifest.xml\n file must be in the app package.\n\n\n\n\nDevelopers often look up AllJoyn samples to learn how to \n  use the AllJoyn framework. While getting the source code \n  is usually correct, make sure the \nAndroidManifest.xml\n file \n  is in the app package. \n\n\n\n\nCheck the app for four essential permissions. \n\n\n\n\nxml\n   \nuses-permission android:name= \"android.permission.INTERNET\"\n\n   \n/uses-permission\n\n\nxml\n  \nuses-permission android:name= \"android.permission. \n  CHANGE_WIFI_MULTICAST_STATE\"\n\n  \n/uses-permission\n\n\n\n\nYou need the first two permissions for AllJoyn discovery to work.\n\n\nThe AllJoyn discovery mechanism sends out multicast packets.\n\n\nTo send out multicast packets on Android through an app, \n  add these two permissions to the AndroidManifest.xmlfile \n  of the app.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nxml\n  \nuses-permission android:name= \"android.permission.ACCESS_WIFI_STATE\"\n\n  \n/uses-permission\n\n\nxml\n  \nuses-permission android:name= \"android.permission.CHANGE_WIFI_STATE\"\n\n  \n/uses-permission\n\n\n\n\nYou need the second two permissions when using AllJoyn 2.5 \n    or above and want to use ICE, which is an alternate transport \n    in the AllJoyn framework.\n\n\nAllJoyn 2.5 has a feature called proximity service that \ndetermines when you are near someone, i.e., you are proximal \nto another AllJoyn service/client.\n\n\nOne method for determining proximity is matching the \naccess points that the devices see. If the devices see \na common set of access points, it is safe to say that \nthey are near each other.\n\n\nThese two permissions allow an app to request and use \nthe access point information provided by Android.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPeer presence detection\n\n\nHow do I know when a peer is no longer available, or has moved \nout of range when I was talking to, or in a session with, that peer?\n\n\nBackground\n\n\nThe AllJoyn framework has three kinds of main listeners (excluding \nAuthListener\n)\n\n\n\n\nBusListener\n\n\n\n\nHas callbacks for \nFoundAdvertisedName\n, \nNameOwnerChanged\n, and \nNameLost\n.\n\n\n\n\nSessionPortListener\n\n\n\n\nTypically used by a peer that is hosting a session/service; \n  you can have two callbacks inside your implementation of this listener.\n\n\n\n\nacceptSessionJoiner\n - A service uses this callback to \n  accept or reject peers that have sent it a request to join a session.\n\n\n\n\nsessionJoined\n - The bus calls this callback when a client \n  joins a service. This is called on the service side if it \n  implements the \nSessionPortListener\n.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSessionListener\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThis listener has callbacks that the service and client can \n  implement to get notifications about who joined or left the session.\n\n\n\n\nsessionLost\n - The bus calls this callback when the \n  last member of the session has left.\n\n\n\n\nTIP:\n Developers might look at the service as one of the \n  members of the session and therefore think that as long \n  as the service is up, the session is up. This seems true \n  logically, but actually, a session must have two or more \n  peers. Thus, having the service up does not necessarily \n  mean there is a session. Further, on Wi-Fi, if the session \n  owner leaves, the session is still up, and communication can \n  flow, but new users can now join.\n\n\n\n\nsessionMemberAdded\n - The bus calls this callback when \n  a member is added to a multipoint session. This more frequently \n  helps the client keep track of who joined the session.\n\n\nsessionMemberRemoved\n - Useful for tracking the member \n  that left a session and can be used by the service and \n  the client. The service typically has a way (using \nsessionJoined\n \n  from the \nSessionPortListener\n) to find out who joined \n  the session without using sessionMemberAdded. Use only \n  \nsessionMemberRemoved\n to track who left the session.\n\n\n\n\nApproach\n\n\nNow that we covered the listeners, you might assume that this \nis easy, and that you just need to track the \nsessionMemberRemoved\n \ncallbacks to know if a peer to whom you were talking has left \nthe session. This is correct, but these steps can help considerably.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nIs the link still up, or has it gone down since the peer \nmoved out of range?\n\n\n\n\n\n\nEvery time two peers connect, i.e., are in a session, \n  there is a link between them. A link between them implies \n  a link between their respective daemons.\n\n\n\n\nWe are looking for a way to find out if the link is \n  still up, or has gone down since the peer moved out of range.\n\n\n\n\nWe can use a timeout for the link, so that if the link has \n  been inactive for a specified period of time, we can conclude \n  that it has gone down.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nIs there a way to set this timeout value manually, so that \nI don't have to wait too long?\n\n\n\n\n\n\nYes! You can manually set the link timeout using \nSetLinkTimeout()\n.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTIP:\n If set to a value \n 40 seconds, the default is 40 seconds.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nWhy do we do this?    \n\n\n\n\n\n\nIn a TCP or UDP connection, resources are consumed when \n  we have to send out a probe checking the status of the link.\n\n\n\n\nIf we set a value of \n 40 seconds, the battery is consumed \n  at an unsatisfactory rate.\n\n\n\n\nA developer might wonder why the battery is draining when \n  no message is being sent. This is not AllJoyn-specific, \n  but the nature of the network transport.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAre you using Bluetooth\u00ae?\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSetLinkTimeout\n has no apparent effect because for Bluetooth, \n  sending probing signals does not consume measurably more resources \n  than maintaining the link. If the link is up, probing to establish \n  whether the link is still up does not consume as many resources \n  as it does in TCP.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nWhen to set a link timeout?\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSetting a link timeout when you establish a session would be ideal.\n\n\n\n\nIf you are waiting for a \nsessionMemberRemoved\n to be \n  called for the peer that is no longer in the session because \n  it has moved out of range, you must wait at least 40 seconds \n  (or even longer) if you have specified a longer time. If the \n  peer had not gone out of the coverage area and had closed \n  down cleanly, you would not have to wait 40 seconds and \n  could have received the \nsessionMemberRemoved\n callback instantly.\n\n\n\n\nAllJoyn apps not detecting each other\n\n\nI have two or more devices/machines on which AllJoyn apps \nare running. I ran everything as instructed in the documentation. \nWhy are my devices not seeing each other?\n\n\n\n\nIs the AllJoyn daemon running on both devices?\n\n\nAre all the devices connected to the same Wi-Fi network? \nIf using Bluetooth, make sure the devices are within range \nof each other.\n\n\nDoes your Wi-Fi network block multicast packets? (This is \nfalse in most cases, but especially true in office environments.)\n\n\nAre you advertising a correctly formed, well-known name? \nWell-known names can contain letters, numbers, underscores \n(_), and a dot (.)\n\n\nAre you discovering a prefix or the correct name on the client side?\n\n\nIf steps 1 through 5 check out, and you are still unable \nto discover the service on a device, ping the other device.\n\n\n\n\nI installed the Java Android samples provided in the\n\n\nAllJoyn SDK, but they don't work on my device or emulator.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe AllJoyn samples included in the SDK are built to \nrun on devices or an emulator running Android version Gingerbread \nor above.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAn AllJoyn app running in an emulator cannot communicate \nwith any other app outside the emulator. This is the way the \nemulator in Android is designed. It is not a restriction of \nthe AllJoyn framework.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nER_BUS_REPLY_IS_ERROR_MESSAGE and \"Invalid busname\" errors\n\n\nI am trying to advertise a name over AllJoyn but it gives \nme ER_BUS_REPLY_IS_ERROR_MESSAGE and an error \"Invalid busname.\"\n\n\nThe AllJoyn framewrok uses the DBus wire protocol and thus \nhas predefined rules on how to form names. Follow these rules \nwhen choosing a name to be advertised:\n\n\n\n\nBus names that start with a colon (':') character are unique \nconnection names. Other bus names are called well-known bus names.\n\n\nBus names comprise one or more element(s) separated by a \nperiod ('.') character. All elements must contain at least one character.\n\n\nEach element must contain only the ASCII characters \"[A-Z][a-z][0-9]_-\". \nOnly elements that are part of a unique connection name may begin \nwith a digit; elements in other bus names must not begin with a digit.\n\n\nBus names must contain at least one '.' (period) character \n(and thus at least two elements).\n\n\nBus names must not begin with a '.' (period) character.\n\n\nBus names must not exceed the maximum name length.\n\n\n\n\nThe same rules apply when requesting a well-known name on the bus.\n\n\nEfficiently sending large amounts of data\n\n\nThe AllJoyn framework has three ways to send data across to a peer.\n\n\n\n\nMethod calls\n\n\n\n\nMethod calls suit short reply response interactions. \n  However, for something like transferring a file, the overhead \n  is greater for making a call and getting a response \n  than it is for signals.\n\n\n\n\nSignals\n\n\n\n\nSignals are unidirectional. A sender just places data in \n  the body of the signal and sends it. This is useful considering \n  the maximum amount of data one can send in an AllJoyn message \n  is 128 Kb. If the file size is smaller, any of the methods \n  to send data are fine. But, if the file size is greater, \n  a good practice is to break the data into chunks and send it using signals.\n\n\n\n\nRaw sockets\n\n\n\n\nRaw sockets is an evolving concept in the AllJoyn framework. \n  The idea is to obtain a raw socket to which you can write data, \n  and the peer can read it as it would from a regular socket. \n  When using Java bindings for AllJoyn, one thing to note is \n  that the raw Java socket returned by the AllJoyn framework \n  is a non-blocking socket, so one should avoid writing a large \n  amount of data rapidly on this socket. Sending 255 bytes \n  at a time is recommended.\n\n\nApp hangs when using the AllJoyn framework\n\n\nA few possibilities:\n\n\n\n\nThe AllJoyn framework has both synchronous and asynchronous \ncalls which means it can block on some calls. When we write \nan Android app, we typically have an activity class that \nhandled the UI part. Doing an AllJoyn-related task in this \nmain UI thread can lead to unpredictable wait periods where \nthe app takes time to respond or does not update the UI components as expected.\n\n\nA highly recommended way while using the AllJoyn framework \nin your Android app is to do all AllJoyn-related activities \nin a separate thread; in the context of Android, this is \ntypically a \nBusHandler\n. This assures that all of the AllJoyn-related \nactivities do not interfere with any other component of the Android app.\n\n\n\n\nMultiple bus attachments in one application\n\n\n\n\nA \nBusAttachment\n is a representation of the AllJoyn bus.\n\n\nCreating it is a heavy operation in terms of memory \nand other resources.\n\n\nAvoid creating multiple bus attachments unless there is a \njustification for doing so.\n\n\nA common guideline to follow is determining whether the \ntypes of functionalities provided by the AllJoyn piece in \nyour app are distinct and unrelated. Suppose you have two \ncompletely different modules in your app that use the \nAllJoyn framework for totally unrelated things. In this case, \nconsider creating a separate \nBusAttachment\n. It should, \nhowever, be avoided as much as possible due to the overhead \nin creating and maintaining its lifecycle in an app.\n\n\n\n\nAndroid emulator support\n\n\nIf you installed one instance of an AllJoyn app on an \nAndroid emulator and another instance on a physical \ndevice/different machine/host machine/any other supported \nplatform, your apps will not be able communicate with each \nother.\n\n\nIn terms of networking, the Android emulator acts like a \nclosed black box. It does not let you form TCP connections \noutside the emulator. The AllJoyn framework has few networking \ncomponents like using multicast for discovering other devices \nthat have the AllJoyn framewrok running on them. This, coupled \nwith other restrictions on the emulator, make it impossible \nfor an AllJoyn app to talk to anything outside the emulator. \nYou can always have multiple instances of AllJoyn apps talking \nto each other inside the emulator, but not across the emulator.\n\n\nHow to allow/disallow access to my session\n\n\nThe AllJoyn framework provides the ability to allow/disallow \naccess to a session in the \nAcceptSessionJoiner\n callback. \nThe only information you have at this time is the \nsessionPort\n \nand \njoinerId\n, the user's busId. If you require more checks \nin order to allow access, gather information out-of-band.\n\n\nTwo suggestions follow:\n\n\n\n\nBuild a table based on nameOwnerChanged to correlate \nbusId\n \nwith a \nwellKnownName\n.\n\n\nHave a connect and accept on a different session, communicate \ninformation to determine who the user is, then join the session \nto which you want to allow access.\n\n\n\n\nSingle auto-joining session\n\n\nThe AllJoyn framework has a unique guid that is associated \nwith a \nbusAttachment\n. A simple algorithm is to append onto \nthe advertisements \n\"_\"+ \nbusAttachment\n.getGlobalGUIDString()\n. \nThen, when you discover \nwellKnownNames\n, use a simple algorithm \nof highest (or lowest) GUID value and join that session. \nNow all app instances have a way to use a single multi-point session.\n\n\nNOTE: If you build this type of system, keep in mind an edge case \nwhere devices are coming and going very frequently which means \nsessions are being joined/left very frequently. In this scenario, \na single session that is auto-joined is not ideal. It's worth \nrethinking the application and providing a UI where users can \nselect the sessions to join.\n\n\nAllJoyn Router Node Service on Windows 10\n\n\nWindows 10 includes native support for AllJoyn 14.06. In the Windows\n10 Technical Preview build, you can use the built-in AllJoyn router \nnode service which means that your desktop applications don't need \nto bundle an AllJoyn router node, and you don't need to run a \nstand-alone router node application in order to run AllJoyn desktop \napplications.\n\n\nIn Windows 10 Technical Preview builds, the AllJoyn router node \nservice(AJRouter.dll) must be started manually as follows from an \nelevated command prompt:\n    net start ajrouter\n\n\nIf you need to stop the router node service, you can either reboot \nyour PC, or execute the following command from an elevated command \nprompt:\n    net stop ajrouter\n\n\nMore information about AllJoyn integration in Windows will be available \nin future releases of the AllSeen SDK for Windows.",

Method calls   Method calls suit short reply response interactions. \n  However, for something like transferring a file, the overhead \n  is greater for making a call and getting a response \n  than it is for signals.   Signals   Signals are unidirectional. A sender just places data in \n  the body of the signal and sends it. This is useful considering \n  the maximum amount of data one can send in an AllJoyn message \n  is 128 Kb. If the file size is smaller, any of the methods \n  to send data are fine. But, if the file size is greater, \n  a good practice is to break the data into chunks and send it using signals.   Raw sockets   Raw sockets is an evolving concept in the AllJoyn framework. \n  The idea is to obtain a raw socket to which you can write data, \n  and the peer can read it as it would from a regular socket. \n  When using Java bindings for AllJoyn, one thing to note is \n  that the raw Java socket returned by the AllJoyn framework \n  is a non-blocking socket, so one should avoid writing a large \n  amount of data rapidly on this socket.

Only the Client side of\nthe sample is implemented for the C language. Use the C++ \ndoor_provider\n to act\nas the Service side of this sample.\n\n\nTo start the C Observer sample, do this:\n\n\nAJ_ROOT=~/allseen/core/alljoyn    # the path where you downloaded the\n                                  # core/alljoyn git repository\nOS=linux                          # your operating system (linux, darwin, win7)\nTARGET_CPU=x86                    # your CPU architecture\nVARIANT=debug                     # debug or release\n\n# the following line is only needed for Linux:\nexport LD_LIBRARY_PATH=$AJ_ROOT/build/$OS/$TARGET_CPU/$VARIANT/dist/cpp/lib:$LD_LIBRARY_PATH\n\ncd $AJ_ROOT/build/$OS/$TARGET_CPU/$VARIANT/dist/cpp/bin/samples\n./door_consumer_c\n\n\n\n\nThe usage of \ndoor_consumer_c\n is exactly the same as that of the C++\n\ndoor_consumer\n application.\n\n\nJava (Android)\n\n\nThe Observer sample for Android incorporates both Service and Client aspects in\na single application. You can use the application to publish virtual doors on\nthe bus, and you can use it to observe (and manipulate) all doors that are\npublished on the network (both the ones you are publishing yourself, and those\nthat are published by other instances of the Observer sample).\n\n\nObserver Functionality\n\n\nThe application's main screen is divided in 2 sections. The top section shows a\nlist of discovered doors. Each line states the door's location, bus name, object\npath and a check box indicating whether the door is open (checked) or closed\n(unchecked). A short tap on a door will toggle the door's state (i.e., invoke\nthe \nOpen\n or \nClose\n method on the corresponding proxy object, as appropriate).\nA long press causes the invocation of the door's \nKnockAndRun\n method, which\nwill cause a closed door to open briefly.\n\n\nThe bottom section of the main screen displays a log of incoming AllJoyn\nmessages. Each line in the log represents an event received from a door.

You can use the application to publish virtual doors on\nthe bus, and you can use it to observe (and manipulate) all doors that are\npublished on the network (both the ones you are publishing yourself, and those\nthat are published by other instances of the Observer sample).  Observer Functionality  The application's main screen is divided in 2 sections. The top section shows a\nlist of discovered doors. Each line states the door's location, bus name, object\npath and a check box indicating whether the door is open (checked) or closed\n(unchecked). A short tap on a door will toggle the door's state (i.e., invoke\nthe  Open  or  Close  method on the corresponding proxy object, as appropriate).\nA long press causes the invocation of the door's  KnockAndRun  method, which\nwill cause a closed door to open briefly.  The bottom section of the main screen displays a log of incoming AllJoyn\nmessages. Each line in the log represents an event received from a door.

The following directories are located under build:\n\n\n\n\nabout-docs\n\n\ndarwin\n\n\ndocs\n\n\n\n\nabout-docs and docs directories\n\n\nThe about-docs and docs directories contain the API documentation\nfor the native library (C++) of the AllJoyn framework and the About feature.\n\n\ndarwin directory\n\n\nUnder the darwin directory you will find four folders: arm, armv7, armv7s and x86.\n\n\narm armv7 and armv7s directories\n\n\nThe arm folders contain the native libraries and header files\nfor running the AllJoyn code over the corresponding versions of iOS devices.\n\n\nalljoyn_objc directory\n\n\nThe alljoyn_objc directory contains most of the things relevant\nto an iOS developer. The following sections define each item.\n\n\nAllJoynCodeGenerator\n\n\nThe code generator tool is the best way to get started generating\nthe glue code that makes calls inside the native AllJoyn library.\n\n\nAllJoynFramework\n\n\nAllJoynFramework is the actual binding code that contains the\nimplementation of the publicly exposed Objective-C bindings.\n\n\nAllJoynFramework_iOS\n\n\nAllJoynFramework_iOS is the actual binding code like the\nAllJoyn framework, but is more specific to iOS devices.\n\n\nsamples directory\n\n\nThe samples directory contains both iOS and OS X samples that\ngive you ideas for using the AllJoyn Objective-C bindings.\n\n\nTest directory\n\n\nThe Test directory contains a few tests that can be used\nto test the AllJoyn SDK.\n\n\nOverview of files in the samples\n\n\nThe following section is common to both BasicService and BasicClient.\n\n\nWe first need to understand a few of the common files that\nare a part of the sample code. Not all files in an AllJoyn\niOS sample need to be written from scratch. We have a code\ngenerator tool, which generates much of the glue code and\nyou end up writing very little actual AllJoyn code.\nTo create an AllJoyn Objective-C sample from scratch,\nthe best place to start is the \nAllJoyn Programming Guide for the Objective-C Language\n.\nThis document shows you how to make use of the code generator\nto define the interface and in turn generate glue code that\nmakes a call in the native AllJoyn library. You do not have\nto make calls in the native library yourself.\n\n\nIf we use the code generator for BasicService and BasicClient,\nthe code generated would be four files:\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFile name\n\n\nDescription\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nBasicObject.h\n\n\nThis file shows you the interface implemented by the BusObject that you defined using the xml as input to the code generator.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nBasicObject.m\n\n\nThis file has the Objective-C implementation of the BasicObject.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAJNBasicObject.h\n\n\nThe Objective-C implementation of a bus object needs to map to a C++ implementation that calls in the native AllJoyn library. The code gen tool does this for you and produces the header and source files for this mapping. You need not write the C++ code or bother about how is it done.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAJNBasicObject.mm\n\n\nThis file contains the implementation of C++ BusObject. In the sample, the C++ BusObject is called BasicObjectImpl.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThere are other files in the sample as listed below:\n\n\n\n\nViewController.h\n: This is the View Controller header file\nof this application.\n\n\nViewController.mm\n: This contains the implementation of\nthe View Controller for this application.\n\n\n\n\nWalkthrough of BasicService\n\n\nDevelopers who are not familiar with app development for the\niOS platform can refer to the Apple developer documentation,\nwhich has a set of rich tutorials to understand how a typical\niOS app is structured. For ease of understanding, if you are new\nto iOS development, an iOS app is structured based on MVC architecture,\nwhich means that you will have the following:\n\n\n\n\nA \nView\n, which is your UI and since we use Xcode,\nthis corresponds to Storyboard.\n\n\nA \nController\n, which is your \nViewController.h\n and \nViewController.mm\n\nin the case of our BasicService and BasicClient sample\n\n\nA \nModel\n, which are \nBasicService.h\n and \nBasicService.mm\n\nin the case of BasicService and \nBasicClient.h\n; and \nBasicClient.mm\n\nin the case of BasicClient\n\n\n\n\nLet us look at it from the perspective of how an app is\nloaded and what parts of the source code are called and what do they mean\n\n\nWhen the BasicService app loads up, the viewDidLoad function in ViewController.mm\nis called:\n\n\nCode 1\n\n\n- (void)viewDidLoad\n{\n   [super viewDidLoad];\nself.basicService = [[BasicService alloc] init];\n   self.basicService.delegate = self;\n   [self.basicService startService];\n}\n\n\n\n\nHere, we instantiate BasicService which is the model and\nthen send a message to \nstartService\n.\n\n\nBefore going further, it might be good to look at what is\ninside BasicService.h since we are calling a method of \nBasicService\n.\n\n\nCode 2\n\n\nBasicService.h\n@protocol BasicServiceDelegate \nNSObject\n\n- (void)didReceiveStatusUpdateMessage:(NSString *)message;\n@end\n@interface BasicService : NSObject\n@property (strong, nonatomic) id\nBasicServiceDelegate\n delegate;\n- (void)startService;\n@end\n\n\n\n\nThe first thing we notice is a \n@protocol\n called \nBasicServiceDelegate\n\nwith a method \ndidReceiveStatusUpdateMessage\n. This is in place\nso that the model can send a message to the view controller.\nThe protocol tells the model that the view controller will\nhave this method implemented.\n\n\nThe second thing is the interface \nBasicService\n which has a property\n\nid\nBasicServiceDelegate\n delegate.\n\n\nThe \nViewController\n sets itself as the delegate inside\n\nViewController.m\n so that the model, \nBasicService\n, can\nsend a message to the method \ndidReceiveStatusUpdateMessage\n\nof \nViewController\n using the delegate property.\n\n\nThis is a common way for a model to call a method of a\n\nViewController\n in iOS. Now we turn back our attention to\n\nstartService\n in \nBasicService\n.\n\n\nCode 3\n\n\n- (void)startService\n{\n   dispatch_queue_t serviceQueue = dispatch_queue_create\n(\norg.alljoyn.basic-service.serviceQueue\n, NULL);\n   dispatch_async( serviceQueue, ^{\n      [self run];\n   });\n}\n\n\n\n\nHere we create a dispatch queue called \"org.alljoyn.basic-service.serviceQueue\"\nand call the method \nrun\n. Now let us look at the method \nrun\n.\n\n\nCode 4\n\n\n[self.delegate didReceiveStatusUpdateMessage:[NSString\nstringWithFormat:@\nAllJoyn Library version: %@\\n\n,\n[AJNVersion versionInformation]]];\n\n[self.delegate didReceiveStatusUpdateMessage:[NSString\nstringWithFormat:@\nAllJoyn Library build info: %@\\n\n,\n[AJNVersion buildInformation]]];\n\n\n\n\nThe first few lines of this method print out debugging\ninformation. There are two calls that are interesting.\n\n\nNotice we call \ndidReceiveStatusUpdateMessage\n using the\ndelegate that we had declared in \nCode 3\n.\nThis updates the text view of the app with the message\nparameters that we send it. In the two calls above, we send\nthe AllJoyn library version and a build info string.\n\n\nNext, we create a BusAttachment and assign it to the\nproperty named \nbus\n, which we declared in \nBasicService.h file\n.\nSee \nCode 5\n.\n\n\nCode 5\n\n\nself.bus = [[AJNBusAttachment alloc] initWithApplicationName:@\nBasicService\n\nallowRemoteMessages:YES];\n\n\n\n\nWe then have a condition lock, which is in place so that only\nthread executes the code that follows. We do not want to have\nmultiple threads trying to do AllJoyn things at the same time\nfor this sample.\n\n\nCode 6\n\n\nself.lostSessionCondition = [[NSCondition alloc] init];\n[self.lostSessionCondition lock];\n\n\n\n\nWe then register the bus listener, which essentially has\ncallbacks that indicate if we found an advertised name,\nlost a session, or a name owner changed condition\n\n\nCode 7\n\n\n[self.bus registerBusListener:self];\n\n\n\n\nThe code gen tool produces the implementation stub of\nBus Object which we can now instantiate in our Service code\nwith the line in \nCode 8\n:\n\n\nCode 8\n\n\nself.basicObject = [[BasicObject alloc] initWithBusAttachment:self.bus\nonPath:kBasicServicePath];\n\n\n\n\nAfter we have instantiated the Bus Object, we start the bus:\n\n\nCode 9\n\n\nstatus = [self.bus start];\nif (ER_OK != status) {\n      [self.delegate didReceiveStatusUpdateMessage:@\nBusAttachment::Start\n   failed\\n\n];\n   NSLog(@\nBus start failed.\n);\n}\n\n\n\n\nWe need to register the bus object that we had instantiated\nabove. We do so by calling \nCode 10\n:\n\n\nCode 10\n\n\nstatus = [self.bus registerBusObject:self.basicObject];\nif (ER_OK != status) {\nNSLog(@\nERROR: Could not register bus object\n);\n}\n\n\n\n\nWe started the bus and now need to connect to it, which is done\nby calling the \nconnectWithArguements\n method. The arguments passed\nto this method is a string \"null:\" which indicates the we connect\nto the \"null\" transport. In the context of the AllJoyn framework,\nthis means we are connecting to the AllJoyn router which is a\npart of this app. Some operating systems have the ability to\nrun a separate AllJoyn standalone router process, which the\napp can connect to. Running a separate process is not possible\nin iOS and not beneficial in many ways. We will leave that\ndiscussion here since we are focusing on the sample.\n\n\nCode 11\n\n\nstatus = [self.bus connectWithArguments:@\nnull:\n];\nif (ER_OK != status) {\n   NSLog(@\nBus connect failed.\n);\n   [self.delegate didReceiveStatusUpdateMessage:@\nFailed to connect to null:\ntransport\n];\n}\n\n\n\n\nFor an AllJoyn service we typically request a well-known name,\nbind a session port to that well known name, and then advertise\nthat name so that others who are interested in talking to the\nservice find it and join our session.\n\n\nWe do these three things with the lines of code shown in \nCode 12\n,\n\nCode 13\n, \nCode 14\n, and \nCode 15\n.\n\n\nCode 12\n\n\nstatus = [self.bus requestWellKnownName:kBasicServiceName\nwithFlags:kAJNBusNameFlagReplaceExisting | kAJNBusNameFlagDoNotQueue];\nif (ER_OK != status) {\n   NSLog(@\nERROR: Request for name failed (%@)\n, kBasicServiceName);\n}\n\n\n\n\nThe parameter \nkBasicServiceName\n is the name that we request\nfrom our bus. The name may or may not be available and also\ndepends on the flags that you pass in to the specifier \nwithFlags\n:\n\n\nIn the case of this sample, we pass \nkAJNBusNameFlagReplaceExisting | kAJNBusNameFlagDoNotQueue\n\nwhich tells the bus to replace the existing owner of the name\nwith this service instance and if the name is already taken by\nsomeone do not queue this service waiting for the name to be released.\n\n\nCode 13\n\n\n//\n// bind a session to a service port\n//\n   AJNSessionOptions *sessionOptions = [[AJNSessionOptions alloc]\ninitWithTrafficType:kAJNTrafficMessages supportsMultipoint:YES\nproximity:kAJNProximityAny transportMask:kAJNTransportMaskAny];\n\n\n\n\nBefore calling \nbindSessionPort\n, we need to specify certain\nthings about the session, for example:\n\n\n\n\nWhat kind of traffic would this session be supporting?\n\n\nWould it be a single point or a multipoint session?\n\n\nOver which transports would this session be available?\n\n\n\n\nThese things are specified by using \nAJNSessionOptions\n as shown in \nCode 13\n,\nwhich we pass in to the call to \nbindSesssionOnPort: withOptions: withDelegate:\n\nas shown in \nCode 14\n.\n\n\nCode 14\n\n\n   status = [self.bus bindSessionOnPort:kBasicServicePort\nwithOptions:sessionOptions withDelegate:self];\n   if (ER_OK != status) {\n      NSLog(@\nERROR: Could not bind session on port (%d)\n, kBasicServicePort);\n   }\n\n\n\n\nNext, once we have bound a session to a port we advertise the\nname so that peers, \nBasicClient\n in our case, can find the well-known\nname and join this session. While advertising the name we specify\nthe well-known name and the transport over which we want this\nname to be advertised.\n\n\nCode 15\n\n\n// advertise a name\n//\nstatus = [self.bus advertiseName:kBasicServiceName withTransportMask:kAJNTransportMaskAny];\nif (ER_OK != status) {\nNSLog(@\nCould not advertise (%@)\n, kBasicServiceName);\n}\n\n\n\n\nAfter we are done advertising the name we wait for the clients\nto connect to us. In our sample, we specify the time to wait\nbefore cleaning up as 60 seconds . The \nlostSession\n condition waits\nuntil it gets a signal, which is sent to it when the session\nis lost. You see the signal being sent to this condition inside\nof the \nsessionWasLost:\n callback which is a part of the \nAJNSessionListener\n interface.\n\n\nCode 16\n\n\n// wait until the client leaves before tearing down the service\n// [self.lostSessionCondition waitUntilDate:[NSDate\ndateWithTimeIntervalSinceNow:60]];\n\n\n\n\nIn the end, we perform cleanup by unregistering the bus object,\nreleasing the lock on the condition property and deallocating\nthe bus property by setting it to \nnil\n.\n\n\nCode 17\n\n\n[self.bus unregisterBusObject:self.basicObject];\n[self.lostSessionCondition unlock];\nself.bus = nil;\n\n\n\n\nWe have a several callback methods that are a part of three\ndifferent listeners. A brief description of each one grouped\nby listener category is mentioned in the sections that follow.\n\n\nAJNBusListener methods\n\n\nCode 18\n\n\n(void)listenerDidRegisterWithBus:(AJNBusAttachment*)busAttachment\n\n\n\n\nThis is invoked when \nregisterBusListener\n is completed\nsuccessfully and the bus notifies the application about it.\n\n\nCode 19\n\n\n(void)listenerDidUnregisterWithBus:(AJNBusAttachment*)busAttachment\n\n\n\n\nThis is invoked when the \nBusListener\n unregisters from the bus.\n\n\nCode 20\n\n\n(void)nameOwnerChanged:(NSString*)name to:(NSString*)newOwner\nfrom:(NSString*)previousOwner\n\n\n\n\nThis is called when there is a change in the ownership of a name on the bus.\nThe name could be a unique name or a well-known name.\n\n\nCode 21\n\n\n(void)busWillStop\n\n\n\n\nThis is called when a \nBusAttachment\n, with which a listener\nis registered, is stopping.\n\n\nCode 22\n\n\n(void)busDidDisconnect\n\n\n\n\nThis is called when a \nBusAttachment\n, with which this listener\nis registered, has become disconnected from the bus.\n\n\nAJNSessionPortListener methods\n\n\nOnly the session host uses this category of listener since\nit will not have any effect on the client side.\n\n\nCode 23\n\n\n(BOOL)shouldAcceptSessionJoinerNamed:(NSString*)joiner\nonSessionPort:(AJNSessionPort)sessionPort\nwithSessionOptions:(AJNSessionOptions*)options\n\n\n\n\nThis is one of the most important callback functions that\nalmost every service will have. When a peer initiates a\njoin session for the session hosted by a service this callback\nis invoked so that the service may accept or reject the \njoin\n\nsession request initiated by the client. It gives us the unique\nname of the joiner who initiated the \njoin\n session request,\nthe port of the session used and the session options that\nthe client wishes to use for the life of this session.\n\n\nCode 24\n\n\n(void)didJoin:(NSString*)joiner inSessionWithId:(AJNSessionId)sessionId\nonSessionPort:(AJNSessionPort)sessionPort\n\n\n\n\nIf a service accepts a \njoin\n session request sent by a client,\nthe client joins the session and the service is notified about\nthe successful joining of the client through this callback.\nThis means that the session is fully up and running.\nIt indicates the unique name of the joiner, the session id\nthat it is a part of and the session port which was used\nfor joining the session.\n\n\nAJNSessionListener methods\n\n\nCode 25\n\n\n- (void)sessionWasLost:(AJNSessionId)sessionId\n\n\n\n\nThe bus invokes this callback when an existing session\nbecomes disconnected and is no longer valid.\n\n\nCode 26\n\n\n- (void)didAddMemberNamed:(NSString*)memberName\ntoSession:(AJNSessionId)sessionId\n\n\n\n\nThis callback indicates that a member with unique name \nmemberName\n\nwas added to the session with session id of the second argument.\n\n\nCode 27\n\n\n- (void)didRemoveMemberNamed:(NSString*)memberName\nfromSession:(AJNSessionId)sessionId\n\n\n\n\nThis callback indicates that a member with unique name\n\nmemberName\n is no longer a part of the session with\nsession id having value \nsessionId\n.\n\n\nThis ends the description of code found under BasicService.\n\n\nWalkthrough of BasicClient\n\n\nThe BasicClient app starts with a button being displayed,\nwhich says \"Call Service\". When the button is pressed,\nthe \ndidTouchCallServiceButton\n method is called.\n\n\nCode 28\n\n\n- (IBAction)didTouchCallServiceButton:(id)sender\n{\n   self.basicClient = [[BasicClient alloc] init];\n   self.basicClient.delegate = self; [self.basicClient sendHelloMessage];\n}\n\n\n\n\nHere, we instantiate \nBasicClient\n and call the \nsendHelloMessage\n method.\n\n\nBefore looking at the \nsendHelloMessage\n, it would be useful\nto understand what is inside the \nBasicClient.h\n file\n\n\nCode 29\n\n\n@protocol BasicClientDelegate \nNSObject\n\n- (void)didReceiveStatusUpdateMessage:(NSString *)message;\n@end\n@interface BasicClient : NSObject\n@property (nonatomic, weak) NSObject\nBasicClientDelegate\n *delegate;\n- (void)sendHelloMessage;\n@end\n\n\n\n\nThe first thing we notice is a @protocol called \nBasicCLientDelegate\n\nwith a method \ndidReceiveStatusUpdateMessage\n. This is in place\nso that the model can send a message to the view controller.\nThe protocol tells the model that the view controller will\nhave this method implemented.\n\n\nThe second thing is the interface \nBasicClient\n, which has a\nproperty \nid\nBasicClientDelegate\n delegate.\n\n\nThe \nViewController\n sets itself as the delegate inside\n\nViewController.m\n so that the model, \nBasicClient\n, can\nsend a message to the method \ndidReceiveStatusUpdateMessage\n\nof \nViewController\n using the delegate property.\n\n\nThis is a common way for a model to call a method of a\n\nViewController\n in iOS. Now we turn back our attention\nto \nsendHelloMessage\n in \nBasicClient\n.\n\n\nCode 30\n\n\n- (void)sendHelloMessage\n{\n   dispatch_queue_t clientQueue =\ndispatch_queue_create(\norg.alljoyn.basic-service.clientQueue\n,NULL);\n   dispatch_async( clientQueue, ^{ [self run];\n   });\n}\n\n\n\n\nThe \nsendHelloMessage\n creates a dispatch queue and then\ncalls the \nrun\n method from here.\n\n\nBefore we head in the \nrun\n method, let's look at a few properties\nthat are defined inside of \nBasicClient\n.\n\n\n\n\n@property (nonatomic, strong ) AJNBusAttachment *bus\n\n\n\n\nRepresents the bus attachment we use in the client code.\n\n\n\n\n@property ( nonatomic, strong) NSCondition *joinedSessionCondition\n\n\n\n\nNSCondition used to signal that we have joined a session\n  after finding an advertised name.\n\n\n\n\n@property (nonatomic) AJNSessionId sessionId\n\n\n\n\nUsed to hold the session id of the session that the client\n  would become a part of.\n\n\n\n\n@property ( nonatomic, strong) NSString *foundServiceName\n\n\n\n\nUsed to hold the well-known name of the service it found\n  when it was looking for an advertised name.\n\n\n\n\n@property (nonatomic, strong) BasicObjectProxy *basicObjectProxy\n\n\n\n\nIt is the proxy bus object, which will represent the bus\n  object of Basic service.\n\n\n\n\n@property BOOL wasNameAlreadyFound\n\n\n\n\nUsed to indicate if the name we are looking for was already found.\n\n\nNow let us look at the run function. The first few lines are\ndebugging information printing out the AllJoyn library version\nthe build info string by calling the method \ndidReceiveStatusUpdateMessage\n\nthat the \nViewController\n should have implemented.\n\n\nCode 31\n\n\nNSLog(@\nAllJoyn Library version: %@\n, AJNVersion.versionInformation);\n   NSLog(@\nAllJoyn Library build info: %@\\n\n, AJNVersion.buildInformation);\n   [self.delegate didReceiveStatusUpdateMessage:AJNVersion.versionInformation];\n\n   [self.delegate didReceiveStatusUpdateMessage:AJNVersion.buildInformation];\n//\n// create the message bus\n//\n   self.bus = [[AJNBusAttachment alloc] initWithApplicationName:@\nBasicClient\n\nallowRemoteMessages:YES]\n\n\n\n\nHere, we created the bus attachment that will allow us to talk to the bus.\nNext, we start the bus.\n\n\nCode 32\n\n\nstatus = [self.bus start];\n\n\n\n\nOnce we have started the bus, we connect to it. A short description\non why do we pass \"null:\" and what does it imply is mentioned\nin BasicService section when we explain \nCode 11\n.\n\n\nCode 33\n\n\nstatus = [self.bus connectWithArguments:@\nnull:\n];\n\n\n\n\nNext we use an NSCondition, which will be eventually\nused to receive the indication that the session was joined.\n\n\nCode 34\n\n\nself.joinedSessionCondition = [[NSCondition alloc] init];\n[self.joinedSessionCondition lock];\n\n\n\n\nWe register the bus listener, which is nothing but this instance of BasicClient.\n\n\nCode 35\n\n\n// register a bus listener in order to receive discovery notifications\n//\n[self.bus registerBusListener:self];\n\n\n\n\nNext, we want to find the well-known name advertised by the BasicService.\n\n\nCode 36\n\n\n// begin discovery of the well known name of the service to be called\n// [self.bus findAdvertisedName:kBasicClientServiceName];\n\n\n\n\nIt is easier to understand the code from here on if we know\nwhat happens when we find the exact name or the names that\nhave the prefix that we supplied to the method in \nCode 36\n.\n\nCode 37\n shows the callback that gets called.\n\n\nCode 37\n\n\n- (void)didFindAdvertisedName:(NSString*)name\nwithTransportMask:(AJNTransportMask)transport namePrefix:(NSString*)namePrefix\n{\n   NSLog(@\nAJNBusListener::didFindAdvertisedName:%@ withTransportMask:%u\nnamePrefix:%@\n, name, transport, namePrefix);\n      if ([namePrefix compare:kBasicClientServiceName] == NSOrderedSame) {\n\n      BOOL shouldReturn;\n      @synchronized(self) {\n         shouldReturn = self.wasNameAlreadyFound;\n         self.wasNameAlreadyFound = true;\n      }\n\n      if (shouldReturn) {\n         NSLog(@\nAlready found an advertised name, ignoring this name\n%@...\n, name);\n         return;\n      }\n\n      // Since we are in a callback we must enable concurrent callbacks\nbefore calling a synchronous method.\n      //\n      [self.bus enableConcurrentCallbacks];\n\n      self.sessionId = [self.bus joinSessionWithName:name\nonPort:kBasicClientServicePort withDelegate:self\noptions:[[AJNSessionOptions alloc] initWithTrafficType:kAJNTrafficMessages\nsupportsMultipoint:YES proximity:kAJNProximityAny transportMask:kAJNTransportMaskAny]];\n\n      if (self.sessionId) {\n         self.foundServiceName = name;\n\n         NSLog(@\nClient joined session %d\n, self.sessionId);\n         [self.delegate didReceiveStatusUpdateMessage:[NSString\nstringWithFormat:@\nJoinSession SUCCESS (Session id=%d)\\n\n, self.sessionId]];\n      }\n      else {\n         [self.delegate didReceiveStatusUpdateMessage:@\nJoinSession\nfailed\\n\n];\n      }\n\n      [self.joinedSessionCondition signal];\n   }\n}\n\n\n\n\nLet's see what is happening in here. We first compare if the\nname that we found is the same as what we were looking for or\nhas the name we were looking for as its prefix. If we have already\nreceived the name, we return.\n\n\nCode 38\n\n\n   BOOL shouldReturn;\n      @synchronized(self) {\n         shouldReturn = self.wasNameAlreadyFound;\n         self.wasNameAlreadyFound = true;\n      }\n\n      if (shouldReturn) {\n         NSLog(@\nAlready found an advertised name, ignoring this name\n%@...\n, name);\n         return;\n      }\n\n\n\n\nNext, let us assume that we saw this name for the first time,\nwhich means that we can join the session.\n\n\nCode 39\n\n\n// Since we are in a callback we must enable concurrent\ncallbacks before calling a synchronous method.\n//\n   [self.bus enableConcurrentCallbacks];\n\n\n\n\nThe call to \nenableConcurrentCallbacks\n is in place so that\nwe can make a synchronous call inside an asynchronous method.\n\n\nCode 40\n\n\nself.sessionId = [self.bus joinSessionWithName:name\nonPort:kBasicClientServicePort withDelegate:self options:[[AJNSessionOptions alloc]\ninitWithTrafficType:kAJNTrafficMessages supportsMultipoint:YES\nproximity:kAJNProximityAny transportMask:kAJNTransportMaskAny]];\n\n      if (self.sessionId) {\n         self.foundServiceName = name;\n\n         NSLog(@\nClient joined session %d\n, self.sessionId);\n\n         [self.delegate didReceiveStatusUpdateMessage:[NSString\nstringWithFormat:@\nJoinSession SUCCESS (Session id=%d)\\n\n, self.sessionId]];\n      }\n      else {\n         [self.delegate didReceiveStatusUpdateMessage:@\nJoinSession\nfailed\\n\n];\n      }\n\n\n\n\nNext, we called \njoinSessionWithName\n. The arguments here are:\n\n\n\n\nName of the session we want to join\n\n\nPort on which the session host is listening\n\n\nA delegate class which will handle session related callbacks\n\n\nOptions to specify session parameters\n\n\nType of traffic that will go over the session\n\n\nBoolean indicating if the session we are joining is a\npoint-to-point or a multipoint session\n\n\nProximity type\n\n\nTransport mask specifying the transport over which we want\nto join this session\n\n\n\n\nCode 41\n\n\n[self.joinedSessionCondition signal];\n\n\n\n\nAnd, in the end, we signal the \njoinSessionCondition\n so that\nwe can go ahead and make a method call on the service.\n\n\nGoing forward, in order to make a method call on the\n\nBasicService\n, we first need to create a proxy bus object,\nwhich will represent the Basic service object. Calling\nintrospect makes us aware of the interfaces it implements\nso that we can make a correct method call.\n\n\nThe creation of proxy bus object requires the bus attachment,\nname of the service for which we are creating the proxy\nbus object, the object path of the remote object and the session id.\n\n\nAfter creating the proxy bus object we need to know the\ninterfaces that it contains so that we can call the desired method.\nFor this purpose, we call the \nintrospectRemoteObject\n method.\n\n\nFinally, after introspecting the remote object we call the\nmethod \nconcatenateString:withString:\n.\n\n\nIf the method call goes through successfully, we should have\nthe concatenated value in the string \"result\".\n\n\nCode 42\n\n\nif ([self.joinedSessionCondition waitUntilDate:[NSDate\ndateWithTimeIntervalSinceNow:60]]) {\n\n      // once joined to a session, use a proxy object to make\nthe function call\n\n//\n      self.basicObjectProxy = [[BasicObjectProxy alloc]\ninitWithBusAttachment:self.bus serviceName:self.foundServiceName\nobjectPath:kBasicClientServicePath sessionId:self.sessionId];\n\n      // get a description of the interfaces implemented by the\nremote object before making the call\n      //\n      [self.basicObjectProxy introspectRemoteObject];\n\n      // now make the function call\n      //\n      NSString *result = [self.basicObjectProxy concatenateString:@\nCode \n\nwithString:@\nMonkies!!!!!!!\n];\n\n      if (result) {\n         NSLog(@\n[%@] %@ concatenated string.\n, result,\n[result compare:@\nCode Monkies!!!!!!!\n] == NSOrderedSame ?\n@\nSuccessfully\n:@\nUnsuccessfully\n);\n         [self.delegate didReceiveStatusUpdateMessage:@\nSuccessfully called\n\nmethod on remote object!!!\\n\n];\n      }\n\n      self.basicObjectProxy = nil;\n\n   }\n   else {\n      NSLog(@\nTimed out while attempting to join a session with\nBasicService...\n);\n      [self.delegate didReceiveStatusUpdateMessage:@\nTimed out while\nattempting to join a session with BasicService...\n];\n   }\n\n\n\n\nWe looked at the flow the program when the user presses\nthe 'Call Service' button on the UI of BasicClient. There is\nanother button on the UI on BasicClient named 'Check Presence'.\nLet us take a look at the flow for that:\nobjc\n\n\nCode 43\n\n\n- (void)sendPing\n{\n   dispatch_queue_t pingQueue =\ndispatch_queue_create(\norg.alljoyn.basic-service.pingQueue\n,NULL);\n   dispatch_async( pingQueue, ^{ [self ping];\n   });\n}\n\n\n\n\nCode 43\n is identical to the behavior we saw when\nwe called the function run. Let us take a look at the function ping below.\n\n\nCode 44\n\n\n- (void)ping\n{\n   if objc(self.bus == NULL) {\n      return;\n   }\n   QStatus status = [self.bus pingPeer:kBasicClientServiceName withTimeout:5];\n\n   if (status == ER_OK) {\n      [self.delegate didReceiveStatusUpdateMessage:@\nPing returned\nSuccessfully\n];\n   } else {\n      [self.delegate didReceiveStatusUpdateMessage:@\nPing Failed\n];\n   }\n}\n\n\n\n\nThe function ping calls the public API pingPeer: withTimeout: inside AJNBusAttachment.\nIt passes the well-known name of the BasicService and the\ntimeout value that reflects how much time will the ping call\nwait before returning. On successfully ping, the text section\non the UI should indicate that the ping call was successful.\n\n\nThis ends the description of BasicClient.\n\n\nThe two samples are in place to illustrate the most simplistic\nmanner in which AllJoyn Objective-C bindings can be used.\nUsing the AllJoyn framework, not only can you write apps\nthat run on separate devices and talk to each other, but you\ncan also write apps that communicate with each other on the\nsame AllJoyn-enabled device. Moreover, the AllJoyn cross-platform\nsupport allows you to easily write your app for Android, Windows,\nand other platforms without having to worry about the problems\nthat the AllJoyn framework solves.\n\n\nThe AllJoyn concepts that we discussed in this document remain\nconsistent when we move to a different platform like Android\nso that the developer spends more time on his actual app rather\nthan worry about the peer-to-peer piece. This gives you the ability\nto quickly write apps that work on different platforms and\ntalk to each other, which is a very important thing in today's\nmobile application development ecosystem.",

This is a simple demonstration wherein\nthe client sends two strings to the service, the service\nconcatenates the strings sent by the client and returns a single string.  Components Used to Write a Sample  The AllJoyn  Objective-C bindings are based on the fact that\nany AllJoyn Objective C-code that you write will hit the native AllJoyn library.  When you download the AllJoyn SDK for iOS and OS X,\nthe typical structure of the SDK and its components is followed:   build  alljoyn_objc  services  LICENSE  README.txt  README.md  ReleaseNotes.txt   The following sections define each one of these directories and their role.  build directory  If you were to build the AllJoyn source for Darwin (iOS/OS X)\nby issuing a SCons command, the build directory is the build\noutput. The following directories are located under build:   about-docs  darwin  docs   about-docs and docs directories  The about-docs and docs directories contain the API documentation\nfor the native library (C++) of the AllJoyn framework and the About feature.  darwin directory  Under the darwin directory you will find four folders: arm, armv7, armv7s and x86.  arm armv7 and armv7s directories  The arm folders contain the native libraries and header files\nfor running the AllJoyn code over the corresponding versions of iOS devices.  alljoyn_objc directory  The alljoyn_objc directory contains most of the things relevant\nto an iOS developer. The following sections define each item.  AllJoynCodeGenerator  The code generator tool is the best way to get started generating\nthe glue code that makes calls inside the native AllJoyn library.  AllJoynFramework  AllJoynFramework is the actual binding code that contains the\nimplementation of the publicly exposed Objective-C bindings.  AllJoynFramework_iOS  AllJoynFramework_iOS is the actual binding code like the\nAllJoyn framework, but is more specific to iOS devices.  samples directory  The samples directory contains both iOS and OS X samples that\ngive you ideas for using the AllJoyn Objective-C bindings.  Test directory  The Test directory contains a few tests that can be used\nto test the AllJoyn SDK.  Overview of files in the samples  The following section is common to both BasicService and BasicClient.  We first need to understand a few of the common files that\nare a part of the sample code. Not all files in an AllJoyn\niOS sample need to be written from scratch. We have a code\ngenerator tool, which generates much of the glue code and\nyou end up writing very little actual AllJoyn code.\nTo create an AllJoyn Objective-C sample from scratch,\nthe best place to start is the  AllJoyn Programming Guide for the Objective-C Language .\nThis document shows you how to make use of the code generator\nto define the interface and in turn generate glue code that\nmakes a call in the native AllJoyn library. You do not have\nto make calls in the native library yourself.  If we use the code generator for BasicService and BasicClient,\nthe code generated would be four files:     File name  Description      BasicObject.h  This file shows you the interface implemented by the BusObject that you defined using the xml as input to the code generator.    BasicObject.m  This file has the Objective-C implementation of the BasicObject.    AJNBasicObject.h  The Objective-C implementation of a bus object needs to map to a C++ implementation that calls in the native AllJoyn library. The code gen tool does this for you and produces the header and source files for this mapping. You need not write the C++ code or bother about how is it done.    AJNBasicObject.mm  This file contains the implementation of C++ BusObject. In the sample, the C++ BusObject is called BasicObjectImpl.     There are other files in the sample as listed below:   ViewController.h : This is the View Controller header file\nof this application.  ViewController.mm : This contains the implementation of\nthe View Controller for this application.",

            "text": "Developers who are not familiar with app development for the\niOS platform can refer to the Apple developer documentation,\nwhich has a set of rich tutorials to understand how a typical\niOS app is structured. For ease of understanding, if you are new\nto iOS development, an iOS app is structured based on MVC architecture,\nwhich means that you will have the following:   A  View , which is your UI and since we use Xcode,\nthis corresponds to Storyboard.  A  Controller , which is your  ViewController.h  and  ViewController.mm \nin the case of our BasicService and BasicClient sample  A  Model , which are  BasicService.h  and  BasicService.mm \nin the case of BasicService and  BasicClient.h ; and  BasicClient.mm \nin the case of BasicClient   Let us look at it from the perspective of how an app is\nloaded and what parts of the source code are called and what do they mean  When the BasicService app loads up, the viewDidLoad function in ViewController.mm\nis called:  Code 1  - (void)viewDidLoad\n{\n   [super viewDidLoad];\nself.basicService = [[BasicService alloc] init];\n   self.basicService.delegate = self;\n   [self.basicService startService];\n}  Here, we instantiate BasicService which is the model and\nthen send a message to  startService .  Before going further, it might be good to look at what is\ninside BasicService.h since we are calling a method of  BasicService .  Code 2  BasicService.h\n@protocol BasicServiceDelegate  NSObject \n- (void)didReceiveStatusUpdateMessage:(NSString *)message;\n@end\n@interface BasicService : NSObject\n@property (strong, nonatomic) id BasicServiceDelegate  delegate;\n- (void)startService;\n@end  The first thing we notice is a  @protocol  called  BasicServiceDelegate \nwith a method  didReceiveStatusUpdateMessage . This is in place\nso that the model can send a message to the view controller.\nThe protocol tells the model that the view controller will\nhave this method implemented.  The second thing is the interface  BasicService  which has a property id BasicServiceDelegate  delegate.  The  ViewController  sets itself as the delegate inside ViewController.m  so that the model,  BasicService , can\nsend a message to the method  didReceiveStatusUpdateMessage \nof  ViewController  using the delegate property.  This is a common way for a model to call a method of a ViewController  in iOS. Now we turn back our attention to startService  in  BasicService .  Code 3  - (void)startService\n{\n   dispatch_queue_t serviceQueue = dispatch_queue_create\n( org.alljoyn.basic-service.serviceQueue , NULL);\n   dispatch_async( serviceQueue, ^{\n      [self run];\n   });\n}  Here we create a dispatch queue called \"org.alljoyn.basic-service.serviceQueue\"\nand call the method  run . Now let us look at the method  run .  Code 4  [self.delegate didReceiveStatusUpdateMessage:[NSString\nstringWithFormat:@ AllJoyn Library version: %@\\n ,\n[AJNVersion versionInformation]]];\n\n[self.delegate didReceiveStatusUpdateMessage:[NSString\nstringWithFormat:@ AllJoyn Library build info: %@\\n ,\n[AJNVersion buildInformation]]];  The first few lines of this method print out debugging\ninformation. There are two calls that are interesting.  Notice we call  didReceiveStatusUpdateMessage  using the\ndelegate that we had declared in  Code 3 .\nThis updates the text view of the app with the message\nparameters that we send it. In the two calls above, we send\nthe AllJoyn library version and a build info string.  Next, we create a BusAttachment and assign it to the\nproperty named  bus , which we declared in  BasicService.h file .\nSee  Code 5 .  Code 5  self.bus = [[AJNBusAttachment alloc] initWithApplicationName:@ BasicService \nallowRemoteMessages:YES];  We then have a condition lock, which is in place so that only\nthread executes the code that follows. We do not want to have\nmultiple threads trying to do AllJoyn things at the same time\nfor this sample.  Code 6  self.lostSessionCondition = [[NSCondition alloc] init];\n[self.lostSessionCondition lock];  We then register the bus listener, which essentially has\ncallbacks that indicate if we found an advertised name,\nlost a session, or a name owner changed condition  Code 7  [self.bus registerBusListener:self];  The code gen tool produces the implementation stub of\nBus Object which we can now instantiate in our Service code\nwith the line in  Code 8 :  Code 8  self.basicObject = [[BasicObject alloc] initWithBusAttachment:self.bus\nonPath:kBasicServicePath];  After we have instantiated the Bus Object, we start the bus:  Code 9  status = [self.bus start];\nif (ER_OK != status) {\n      [self.delegate didReceiveStatusUpdateMessage:@ BusAttachment::Start\n   failed\\n ];\n   NSLog(@ Bus start failed. );\n}  We need to register the bus object that we had instantiated\nabove. We do so by calling  Code 10 :  Code 10  status = [self.bus registerBusObject:self.basicObject];\nif (ER_OK != status) {\nNSLog(@ ERROR: Could not register bus object );\n}  We started the bus and now need to connect to it, which is done\nby calling the  connectWithArguements  method. The arguments passed\nto this method is a string \"null:\" which indicates the we connect\nto the \"null\" transport. In the context of the AllJoyn framework,\nthis means we are connecting to the AllJoyn router which is a\npart of this app. Some operating systems have the ability to\nrun a separate AllJoyn standalone router process, which the\napp can connect to. Running a separate process is not possible\nin iOS and not beneficial in many ways. We will leave that\ndiscussion here since we are focusing on the sample.  Code 11  status = [self.bus connectWithArguments:@ null: ];\nif (ER_OK != status) {\n   NSLog(@ Bus connect failed. );\n   [self.delegate didReceiveStatusUpdateMessage:@ Failed to connect to null:\ntransport ];\n}  For an AllJoyn service we typically request a well-known name,\nbind a session port to that well known name, and then advertise\nthat name so that others who are interested in talking to the\nservice find it and join our session.  We do these three things with the lines of code shown in  Code 12 , Code 13 ,  Code 14 , and  Code 15 .  Code 12  status = [self.bus requestWellKnownName:kBasicServiceName\nwithFlags:kAJNBusNameFlagReplaceExisting | kAJNBusNameFlagDoNotQueue];\nif (ER_OK != status) {\n   NSLog(@ ERROR: Request for name failed (%@) , kBasicServiceName);\n}  The parameter  kBasicServiceName  is the name that we request\nfrom our bus. The name may or may not be available and also\ndepends on the flags that you pass in to the specifier  withFlags :  In the case of this sample, we pass  kAJNBusNameFlagReplaceExisting | kAJNBusNameFlagDoNotQueue \nwhich tells the bus to replace the existing owner of the name\nwith this service instance and if the name is already taken by\nsomeone do not queue this service waiting for the name to be released.  Code 13  //\n// bind a session to a service port\n//\n   AJNSessionOptions *sessionOptions = [[AJNSessionOptions alloc]\ninitWithTrafficType:kAJNTrafficMessages supportsMultipoint:YES\nproximity:kAJNProximityAny transportMask:kAJNTransportMaskAny];  Before calling  bindSessionPort , we need to specify certain\nthings about the session, for example:   What kind of traffic would this session be supporting?  Would it be a single point or a multipoint session?  Over which transports would this session be available?   These things are specified by using  AJNSessionOptions  as shown in  Code 13 ,\nwhich we pass in to the call to  bindSesssionOnPort: withOptions: withDelegate: \nas shown in  Code 14 .  Code 14     status = [self.bus bindSessionOnPort:kBasicServicePort\nwithOptions:sessionOptions withDelegate:self];\n   if (ER_OK != status) {\n      NSLog(@ ERROR: Could not bind session on port (%d) , kBasicServicePort);\n   }  Next, once we have bound a session to a port we advertise the\nname so that peers,  BasicClient  in our case, can find the well-known\nname and join this session. While advertising the name we specify\nthe well-known name and the transport over which we want this\nname to be advertised.  Code 15  // advertise a name\n//\nstatus = [self.bus advertiseName:kBasicServiceName withTransportMask:kAJNTransportMaskAny];\nif (ER_OK != status) {\nNSLog(@ Could not advertise (%@) , kBasicServiceName);\n}  After we are done advertising the name we wait for the clients\nto connect to us. In our sample, we specify the time to wait\nbefore cleaning up as 60 seconds . The  lostSession  condition waits\nuntil it gets a signal, which is sent to it when the session\nis lost. You see the signal being sent to this condition inside\nof the  sessionWasLost:  callback which is a part of the  AJNSessionListener  interface.  Code 16  // wait until the client leaves before tearing down the service\n// [self.lostSessionCondition waitUntilDate:[NSDate\ndateWithTimeIntervalSinceNow:60]];  In the end, we perform cleanup by unregistering the bus object,\nreleasing the lock on the condition property and deallocating\nthe bus property by setting it to  nil .  Code 17  [self.bus unregisterBusObject:self.basicObject];\n[self.lostSessionCondition unlock];\nself.bus = nil;  We have a several callback methods that are a part of three\ndifferent listeners. A brief description of each one grouped\nby listener category is mentioned in the sections that follow.  AJNBusListener methods  Code 18  (void)listenerDidRegisterWithBus:(AJNBusAttachment*)busAttachment  This is invoked when  registerBusListener  is completed\nsuccessfully and the bus notifies the application about it.  Code 19  (void)listenerDidUnregisterWithBus:(AJNBusAttachment*)busAttachment  This is invoked when the  BusListener  unregisters from the bus.  Code 20  (void)nameOwnerChanged:(NSString*)name to:(NSString*)newOwner\nfrom:(NSString*)previousOwner  This is called when there is a change in the ownership of a name on the bus.\nThe name could be a unique name or a well-known name.  Code 21  (void)busWillStop  This is called when a  BusAttachment , with which a listener\nis registered, is stopping.  Code 22  (void)busDidDisconnect  This is called when a  BusAttachment , with which this listener\nis registered, has become disconnected from the bus.  AJNSessionPortListener methods  Only the session host uses this category of listener since\nit will not have any effect on the client side.  Code 23  (BOOL)shouldAcceptSessionJoinerNamed:(NSString*)joiner\nonSessionPort:(AJNSessionPort)sessionPort\nwithSessionOptions:(AJNSessionOptions*)options  This is one of the most important callback functions that\nalmost every service will have. When a peer initiates a\njoin session for the session hosted by a service this callback\nis invoked so that the service may accept or reject the  join \nsession request initiated by the client. It gives us the unique\nname of the joiner who initiated the  join  session request,\nthe port of the session used and the session options that\nthe client wishes to use for the life of this session.  Code 24  (void)didJoin:(NSString*)joiner inSessionWithId:(AJNSessionId)sessionId\nonSessionPort:(AJNSessionPort)sessionPort  If a service accepts a  join  session request sent by a client,\nthe client joins the session and the service is notified about\nthe successful joining of the client through this callback.\nThis means that the session is fully up and running.\nIt indicates the unique name of the joiner, the session id\nthat it is a part of and the session port which was used\nfor joining the session.  AJNSessionListener methods  Code 25  - (void)sessionWasLost:(AJNSessionId)sessionId  The bus invokes this callback when an existing session\nbecomes disconnected and is no longer valid.  Code 26  - (void)didAddMemberNamed:(NSString*)memberName\ntoSession:(AJNSessionId)sessionId  This callback indicates that a member with unique name  memberName \nwas added to the session with session id of the second argument.  Code 27  - (void)didRemoveMemberNamed:(NSString*)memberName\nfromSession:(AJNSessionId)sessionId  This callback indicates that a member with unique name memberName  is no longer a part of the session with\nsession id having value  sessionId .

            "location": "/develop/tutorial/ios/#walkthrough-of-basicclient",
            "text": "The BasicClient app starts with a button being displayed,\nwhich says \"Call Service\". When the button is pressed,\nthe  didTouchCallServiceButton  method is called.  Code 28  - (IBAction)didTouchCallServiceButton:(id)sender\n{\n   self.basicClient = [[BasicClient alloc] init];\n   self.basicClient.delegate = self; [self.basicClient sendHelloMessage];\n}  Here, we instantiate  BasicClient  and call the  sendHelloMessage  method.  Before looking at the  sendHelloMessage , it would be useful\nto understand what is inside the  BasicClient.h  file  Code 29  @protocol BasicClientDelegate  NSObject \n- (void)didReceiveStatusUpdateMessage:(NSString *)message;\n@end\n@interface BasicClient : NSObject\n@property (nonatomic, weak) NSObject BasicClientDelegate  *delegate;\n- (void)sendHelloMessage;\n@end  The first thing we notice is a @protocol called  BasicCLientDelegate \nwith a method  didReceiveStatusUpdateMessage . This is in place\nso that the model can send a message to the view controller.\nThe protocol tells the model that the view controller will\nhave this method implemented.  The second thing is the interface  BasicClient , which has a\nproperty  id BasicClientDelegate  delegate.  The  ViewController  sets itself as the delegate inside ViewController.m  so that the model,  BasicClient , can\nsend a message to the method  didReceiveStatusUpdateMessage \nof  ViewController  using the delegate property.  This is a common way for a model to call a method of a ViewController  in iOS. Now we turn back our attention\nto  sendHelloMessage  in  BasicClient .  Code 30  - (void)sendHelloMessage\n{\n   dispatch_queue_t clientQueue =\ndispatch_queue_create( org.alljoyn.basic-service.clientQueue ,NULL);\n   dispatch_async( clientQueue, ^{ [self run];\n   });\n}  The  sendHelloMessage  creates a dispatch queue and then\ncalls the  run  method from here.  Before we head in the  run  method, let's look at a few properties\nthat are defined inside of  BasicClient .   @property (nonatomic, strong ) AJNBusAttachment *bus   Represents the bus attachment we use in the client code.   @property ( nonatomic, strong) NSCondition *joinedSessionCondition   NSCondition used to signal that we have joined a session\n  after finding an advertised name.   @property (nonatomic) AJNSessionId sessionId   Used to hold the session id of the session that the client\n  would become a part of.   @property ( nonatomic, strong) NSString *foundServiceName   Used to hold the well-known name of the service it found\n  when it was looking for an advertised name.   @property (nonatomic, strong) BasicObjectProxy *basicObjectProxy   It is the proxy bus object, which will represent the bus\n  object of Basic service.   @property BOOL wasNameAlreadyFound   Used to indicate if the name we are looking for was already found.  Now let us look at the run function. The first few lines are\ndebugging information printing out the AllJoyn library version\nthe build info string by calling the method  didReceiveStatusUpdateMessage \nthat the  ViewController  should have implemented.  Code 31  NSLog(@ AllJoyn Library version: %@ , AJNVersion.versionInformation);\n   NSLog(@ AllJoyn Library build info: %@\\n , AJNVersion.buildInformation);\n   [self.delegate didReceiveStatusUpdateMessage:AJNVersion.versionInformation];\n\n   [self.delegate didReceiveStatusUpdateMessage:AJNVersion.buildInformation];\n//\n// create the message bus\n//\n   self.bus = [[AJNBusAttachment alloc] initWithApplicationName:@ BasicClient \nallowRemoteMessages:YES]  Here, we created the bus attachment that will allow us to talk to the bus.\nNext, we start the bus.  Code 32  status = [self.bus start];  Once we have started the bus, we connect to it. A short description\non why do we pass \"null:\" and what does it imply is mentioned\nin BasicService section when we explain  Code 11 .  Code 33  status = [self.bus connectWithArguments:@ null: ];  Next we use an NSCondition, which will be eventually\nused to receive the indication that the session was joined.  Code 34  self.joinedSessionCondition = [[NSCondition alloc] init];\n[self.joinedSessionCondition lock];  We register the bus listener, which is nothing but this instance of BasicClient.  Code 35  // register a bus listener in order to receive discovery notifications\n//\n[self.bus registerBusListener:self];  Next, we want to find the well-known name advertised by the BasicService.  Code 36  // begin discovery of the well known name of the service to be called\n// [self.bus findAdvertisedName:kBasicClientServiceName];  It is easier to understand the code from here on if we know\nwhat happens when we find the exact name or the names that\nhave the prefix that we supplied to the method in  Code 36 . Code 37  shows the callback that gets called.  Code 37  - (void)didFindAdvertisedName:(NSString*)name\nwithTransportMask:(AJNTransportMask)transport namePrefix:(NSString*)namePrefix\n{\n   NSLog(@ AJNBusListener::didFindAdvertisedName:%@ withTransportMask:%u\nnamePrefix:%@ , name, transport, namePrefix);\n      if ([namePrefix compare:kBasicClientServiceName] == NSOrderedSame) {\n\n      BOOL shouldReturn;\n      @synchronized(self) {\n         shouldReturn = self.wasNameAlreadyFound;\n         self.wasNameAlreadyFound = true;\n      }\n\n      if (shouldReturn) {\n         NSLog(@ Already found an advertised name, ignoring this name\n%@... , name);\n         return;\n      }\n\n      // Since we are in a callback we must enable concurrent callbacks\nbefore calling a synchronous method.\n      //\n      [self.bus enableConcurrentCallbacks];\n\n      self.sessionId = [self.bus joinSessionWithName:name\nonPort:kBasicClientServicePort withDelegate:self\noptions:[[AJNSessionOptions alloc] initWithTrafficType:kAJNTrafficMessages\nsupportsMultipoint:YES proximity:kAJNProximityAny transportMask:kAJNTransportMaskAny]];\n\n      if (self.sessionId) {\n         self.foundServiceName = name;\n\n         NSLog(@ Client joined session %d , self.sessionId);\n         [self.delegate didReceiveStatusUpdateMessage:[NSString\nstringWithFormat:@ JoinSession SUCCESS (Session id=%d)\\n , self.sessionId]];\n      }\n      else {\n         [self.delegate didReceiveStatusUpdateMessage:@ JoinSession\nfailed\\n ];\n      }\n\n      [self.joinedSessionCondition signal];\n   }\n}  Let's see what is happening in here. We first compare if the\nname that we found is the same as what we were looking for or\nhas the name we were looking for as its prefix. If we have already\nreceived the name, we return.  Code 38     BOOL shouldReturn;\n      @synchronized(self) {\n         shouldReturn = self.wasNameAlreadyFound;\n         self.wasNameAlreadyFound = true;\n      }\n\n      if (shouldReturn) {\n         NSLog(@ Already found an advertised name, ignoring this name\n%@... , name);\n         return;\n      }  Next, let us assume that we saw this name for the first time,\nwhich means that we can join the session.  Code 39  // Since we are in a callback we must enable concurrent\ncallbacks before calling a synchronous method.\n//\n   [self.bus enableConcurrentCallbacks];  The call to  enableConcurrentCallbacks  is in place so that\nwe can make a synchronous call inside an asynchronous method.  Code 40  self.sessionId = [self.bus joinSessionWithName:name\nonPort:kBasicClientServicePort withDelegate:self options:[[AJNSessionOptions alloc]\ninitWithTrafficType:kAJNTrafficMessages supportsMultipoint:YES\nproximity:kAJNProximityAny transportMask:kAJNTransportMaskAny]];\n\n      if (self.sessionId) {\n         self.foundServiceName = name;\n\n         NSLog(@ Client joined session %d , self.sessionId);\n\n         [self.delegate didReceiveStatusUpdateMessage:[NSString\nstringWithFormat:@ JoinSession SUCCESS (Session id=%d)\\n , self.sessionId]];\n      }\n      else {\n         [self.delegate didReceiveStatusUpdateMessage:@ JoinSession\nfailed\\n ];\n      }  Next, we called  joinSessionWithName . The arguments here are:   Name of the session we want to join  Port on which the session host is listening  A delegate class which will handle session related callbacks  Options to specify session parameters  Type of traffic that will go over the session  Boolean indicating if the session we are joining is a\npoint-to-point or a multipoint session  Proximity type  Transport mask specifying the transport over which we want\nto join this session   Code 41  [self.joinedSessionCondition signal];  And, in the end, we signal the  joinSessionCondition  so that\nwe can go ahead and make a method call on the service.  Going forward, in order to make a method call on the BasicService , we first need to create a proxy bus object,\nwhich will represent the Basic service object. Calling\nintrospect makes us aware of the interfaces it implements\nso that we can make a correct method call.  The creation of proxy bus object requires the bus attachment,\nname of the service for which we are creating the proxy\nbus object, the object path of the remote object and the session id.  After creating the proxy bus object we need to know the\ninterfaces that it contains so that we can call the desired method.\nFor this purpose, we call the  introspectRemoteObject  method.  Finally, after introspecting the remote object we call the\nmethod  concatenateString:withString: .  If the method call goes through successfully, we should have\nthe concatenated value in the string \"result\".  Code 42  if ([self.joinedSessionCondition waitUntilDate:[NSDate\ndateWithTimeIntervalSinceNow:60]]) {\n\n      // once joined to a session, use a proxy object to make\nthe function call\n\n//\n      self.basicObjectProxy = [[BasicObjectProxy alloc]\ninitWithBusAttachment:self.bus serviceName:self.foundServiceName\nobjectPath:kBasicClientServicePath sessionId:self.sessionId];\n\n      // get a description of the interfaces implemented by the\nremote object before making the call\n      //\n      [self.basicObjectProxy introspectRemoteObject];\n\n      // now make the function call\n      //\n      NSString *result = [self.basicObjectProxy concatenateString:@ Code  \nwithString:@ Monkies!!!!!!! ];\n\n      if (result) {\n         NSLog(@ [%@] %@ concatenated string. , result,\n[result compare:@ Code Monkies!!!!!!! ] == NSOrderedSame ?\n@ Successfully :@ Unsuccessfully );\n         [self.delegate didReceiveStatusUpdateMessage:@ Successfully called\n\nmethod on remote object!!!\\n ];\n      }\n\n      self.basicObjectProxy = nil;\n\n   }\n   else {\n      NSLog(@ Timed out while attempting to join a session with\nBasicService... );\n      [self.delegate didReceiveStatusUpdateMessage:@ Timed out while\nattempting to join a session with BasicService... ];\n   }  We looked at the flow the program when the user presses\nthe 'Call Service' button on the UI of BasicClient. There is\nanother button on the UI on BasicClient named 'Check Presence'.\nLet us take a look at the flow for that:\nobjc  Code 43  - (void)sendPing\n{\n   dispatch_queue_t pingQueue =\ndispatch_queue_create( org.alljoyn.basic-service.pingQueue ,NULL);\n   dispatch_async( pingQueue, ^{ [self ping];\n   });\n}  Code 43  is identical to the behavior we saw when\nwe called the function run. Let us take a look at the function ping below.  Code 44  - (void)ping\n{\n   if objc(self.bus == NULL) {\n      return;\n   }\n   QStatus status = [self.bus pingPeer:kBasicClientServiceName withTimeout:5];\n\n   if (status == ER_OK) {\n      [self.delegate didReceiveStatusUpdateMessage:@ Ping returned\nSuccessfully ];\n   } else {\n      [self.delegate didReceiveStatusUpdateMessage:@ Ping Failed ];\n   }\n}  The function ping calls the public API pingPeer: withTimeout: inside AJNBusAttachment.\nIt passes the well-known name of the BasicService and the\ntimeout value that reflects how much time will the ping call\nwait before returning. On successfully ping, the text section\non the UI should indicate that the ping call was successful.  This ends the description of BasicClient.  The two samples are in place to illustrate the most simplistic\nmanner in which AllJoyn Objective-C bindings can be used.\nUsing the AllJoyn framework, not only can you write apps\nthat run on separate devices and talk to each other, but you\ncan also write apps that communicate with each other on the\nsame AllJoyn-enabled device. Moreover, the AllJoyn cross-platform\nsupport allows you to easily write your app for Android, Windows,\nand other platforms without having to worry about the problems\nthat the AllJoyn framework solves.  The AllJoyn concepts that we discussed in this document remain\nconsistent when we move to a different platform like Android\nso that the developer spends more time on his actual app rather\nthan worry about the peer-to-peer piece. This gives you the ability\nto quickly write apps that work on different platforms and\ntalk to each other, which is a very important thing in today's\nmobile application development ecosystem.",

You may of course remove\noptional fields such as DateOfManufacture.\n\n\nDepending on the \nAJSVC_PROPERTY_STORE_NUMBER_OF_LANGUAGES\n\nyou've provisioned, this structure must be populated with as\nmany default values. Use NULL for non-provisioned values such\nas when the field is non-language dependent (e.g., DeviceName).\n\n\nWhen provisioning a non-language dependent field, the first\nvalue (at index \nAJSVC_PROPERTY_STORE_NO_LANGUAGE_INDEX\n) is\nused and all other values are ignored, yet must be initialized.\n\n\nAdding custom field definition and values\n\n\nComplete the following steps to add your own custom fields.\n\n\n\n\nDecide to which subset the field belongs and add it to the enumeration\n\nAJSVC_PropertyStoreFieldIndices\n accordingly.\n\n\nAdd a new field entry at the respective index to the propertyStoreProperties.\n\n\nDecide whether the field is publicly accessible from\nremote clients. If the field is public, set the \nmode7Public\n bit to 1.\n\n\nDecide whether the field is to be allowed to be configured\nremotely through the Configuration service framework. If the\nfield is updateable, then set the \nmode0Write\n bit to 1.\n   \nNOTE:\n If you set this bit, the field's index must be included\n   in the Persisted or Config keys subsets.\n\n\nDecide whether the field is to be includedin the Announcement.\nIf the field is announced, then set the \nmode1Announce\n bit to 1.\n  \nNOTE:\n It is recommended to limit the inclusion of a field in\n  the Announcement according to its immediate relevance to the\n  relevant service framework's discovery. Only the value associated\n  with the currentDefaultLanguage will be sent in the Announcement.\n\n\nDecide whether the field is multi-language and add the relevant\nvalues for the provisioned languages. If the field is multi-language,\nthen set the \nmode2MultiLng\n bit to\n1.\n\n\nDecide whether the field is to be provisioned dynamically\nin code and persisted during first-time (or post-factory reset)\ndevice startup. If the field is to be initialized once, then\nset the \nmode3Init\n bit to 1 and add the relevant code to initialize it.\n\n\n\n\nRefer to PropertyStore.c \nPropertyStore_Init()\n and\n   \nInitMandatoryPropertiesInRAM()\n for an example setup\n   for the DeviceId and AppId fields.\n\n\nNOTE:\n If you set this bit, the field's index must be\n  included in the Persisted keys subsets.\n8. Add relevant validation of updated value for your custom\nkey by modifying the default implementation of \nIsValueValid()\n\nin ConfigSample.c file.\n   \nc\n   uint8_t IsValueValid(const char* key, const char* value) {return TRUE;}\n\n9. Add entry in corresponding index of \npropertyStoreDefaultValues\n\nto provision default value(s).\n10. Add entry in corresponding index of \npropertyStoreRuntimeValues\n\nto provision for runtime value(s) buffer(s).\n\n\nNOTE:\n The example implementation of PropertyStore supports\nproperties with value of type String ('s') only. If your\nproperty must be of a different type, you must provision the\ndefault value as a String and perform the relevant de/serialization\non the client side.\n\n\nThe following shows an example of how to add a configurable\nproprietary property named \"MyProperty\" that has a language-dependent value.\n* Add index MyProperty to \nAJSVC_PropertyStoreFieldIndices\n:\n\n\nc\n  MyProperty, AJSVC_PROPERTY_STORE_NUMBER_OF_RUNTIME_KEYS,\n\n\n\n\nAdd a new entry to the \npropertyStoreProperties\n array in\nthe index which corresponds to the enumeration value defined above:\n\n\n\n\nc\n  //{ \"Key Name \", W, A, M, I .. . . ., P },\n  { \"MyProperty\",   1, 0, 1, 0, 0, 0, 0, 1 },\n  // Add other configurable keys above this line\n\n\n\n\nAdd a new entry to the \npropertyStoreDefaultValues\n array\nin the index which corresponds to the enumeration value defined above:\n\n\n\n\nc\n  static const char DEFAULT_MYPROPERTY_LANG1[] = \"My\";\n  static const char DEFAULT_MYPROPERTY_LANG2[] = \"Mein\";\n  static const char* DEFAULT_MYPROPERTIES[] =\n  { DEFAULT_ MYPROPERTY_LANG1, DEFAULT_ MYPROPERTY_LANG2 };\n  ...\n  DEFAULT_MYPROPERTIES, /*MyProperty*/\n  // Add other configurable keys above this line\n\n\nImplement remote callbacks\n\n\nCallbacks are provided by the service frameworks to allow for\nthe application writer to react to various remotely initiated\ncalls and events. In particular, the Configuration service\nframework has callbacks that allow for the application writer\nto react to remote initiated events and the Controlee part\nof the Control Panel service framework has callbacks that allow\nfor the application writer to write the business logic for the ControlPanel model.\n\n\nSee the \nConfiguration API Guide\n and the\n\nControl Panel API Guide\n, respectively, for more information.\n\n\nIntegrate the Configuration service framework with an\n\n\napplication's AuthListener (optional)\n\n\nThe Configuration service framework and other AllJoyn service\nframework interface methods and signals require a secure\nAllJoyn connection. The application writer may choose to use\nan ALLJOYN_ECDHE_PSK authentication mechanism in its AuthListener implementation.\n\n\nThe Configuration service framework enables remote setting\nof a password that can be used as the secret for a key exchange\nauthentication mechanism. An example implementation that uses\nthis facility is included in the sample server application in\nthe ServicesHandlers.c file as shown below.\n\n\nuint32_t PasswordCallback(uint8_t* buffer, uint32_t bufLen)\n{\n   AJ_Status status = AJ_OK;\n   const char* hexPassword;\n   size_t hexPasswordLen;\n   uint32_t len = 0;\n\n   hexPassword = AJSVC_PropertyStore_GetValue(AJSVC_PROPERTY_STORE_PASSCODE);\n   if (hexPassword == NULL) {\n      AJ_ErrPrintf((\nPassword is NULL!\\n\n));\n      return len;\n   }\n   AJ_InfoPrintf((\nRetrieved password=%s\\n\n, hexPassword));\n   hexPasswordLen = strlen(hexPassword);\n   len = hexPasswordLen / 2;\n   status = AJ_HexToRaw(hexPassword, hexPasswordLen, buffer, bufLen);\n   if (status == AJ_ERR_RESOURCES) {\n      len = 0;\n   }\n\n   return len;\n}\n\n\n\n\nThe above implementation calls AJSVC_PropertyStore_GetValue (\nAJSVC_PROPERTY_STORE_PASSCODE\n)\nto retrieve the current password. This implementation relies on an\nextension in the sample implementation of the PropertyStore which\nwas extended with the Passcode field defined in the\n\nAJSVC_PropertyStoreFieldIndices\n enumeration. The field is remotely\nupdateable via a Configuration service framework session using the\ndedicated \nSetPasscode()\n method. The stored Passcode is limited\nto the size of 65, allowing for 64 characters long secret:\n\n\n#define PASSWORD_VALUE_LENGTH 65\n\n\n\n\nThis is achieved using the field definition that masks the\nfield as writable yet private, as shown in the \npropertyStoreProperties\n\ninitialization in PropertyStore.c:\n\n\n{\nPasscode\n, 1, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0 }\n\n\n\n\nThe default value is provisioned in ServerSample.c as follows:\n\n\n// HEX encoded { '0', '0', '0', '0', '0', '0' }\nstatic const char* DEFAULT_PASSCODES[] = { \n303030303030\n };\n\n\n\n\nand added to \npropertyStoreDefaultValues\n.\n\n\nDEFAULT_PASSCODES,\n/*Passcode*/\n\n\n\n\nSince the Passcode enumeration value is less than \nAJSVC_PROPERTY_STORE_NUMBER_OF_RUNTIME_KEYS\n,\nit is also considered part of the \npropertyStoreRuntimeValues\n;\nits modified value is persisted.\n\n\nAlso, when \nSetPasscode()\n is called remotely, the \nSetPasscode()\n\ncallback is invoked with the following example implementation in\nConfigSample.c file as shown below:\n\n\nstatic AJ_Status SetPasscode(const char* daemonRealm, const uint8_t* newPasscode, uint8_t newPasscodeLen)\n{\n   AJ_Status status = AJ_OK;\n\n   char newStringPasscode[PASSWORD_VALUE_LENGTH + 1];\n   status = AJ_RawToHex(newPasscode, newPasscodeLen, newStringPasscode, sizeof(newStringPasscode), FALSE);\n   if (status != AJ_OK) {\n      return status;\n   }\n   if (AJSVC_PropertyStore_SetValue(AJSVC_PROPERTY_STORE_REALM_NAME, daemonRealm)\n\n AJSVC_PropertyStore_SetValue(AJSVC_PROPERTY_STORE_PASSCODE, newStringPasscode))\n{\n\n      status = AJSVC_PropertyStore_SaveAll();\n      if (status != AJ_OK) {\n         return status;\n      }\n      AJ_ClearCredentials();\n      status = AJ_ERR_READ; //Force disconnect of AJ and services to refresh current sessions\n   } else {\n\n      status = AJSVC_PropertyStore_LoadAll();\n      if (status != AJ_OK) {\n         return status;\n      }\n   }\n\n   return status;\n}\n\n\n\n\nThe above implementation stores the passcode as part of the\nPropertyStore persistence:\n\n\n\n\nIt calls \nAJSVC_PropertyStore_SetValue(Passcode, newStringPasscode)\n\nto set the value in RAM.\n\n\nIf successful, it also calls \nAJSVC_PropertyStore_SaveAll()\n\nto persist to NVRAM.\n\n\nFinally, \nAJ_ClearCredentials()\n is called to revoke all\ncurrent keys based on the old passcode.\n\n\n\n\nNOTES\n\n* The stored passcode is HEX and is limited to the size of 32,\nallowing for 16 bytes long secret:\n\n\nc\n  #define PASSWORD_VALUE_LENGTH (AJ_ADHOC_LEN * 2)\n\n\n The default value for the Passcode field is provisioned as\n'303030303030' (the HEX encoded string value for the byte array\n{ '0', '0', '0', '0', '0', '0' }) as per the requirement outlined\nin the \nConfiguration Interface Definition\n.\n\n The realm name is similarly persisted alongside the passcode\nby adding the RealmName field index to the \nAJSVC_PropertyStoreFieldIndices\n\nenumeration and provisioning for it in \npropertyStoreDefaultValues\n\nand \npropertyStoreRuntimeValues\n initialization.\n\n\nCompile the Thin Library Application\n\n\nThis process, including the directory and file layout,\ntoolchains, and procedures varies depending on the host and\ntarget platforms involved, and which AllJoyn service frameworks are being used.\n\n\nRefer to the target platform documentation that contains\ninstructions on how to organize and set up the build process\nto incorporate the necessary files to compile your Thin Library application.",

Refer to\nPropertyStore.c  PropertyStore_Init()  and  InitMandatoryPropertiesInRAM() \nfor an example runtime initialization of the persisted fields.  If the value of a Config field (such as DeviceName) was modified,\nit is stored in the array under the relevant language.  If  ResetConfigurations()  for this field (for some given language)\nor a  globalFactoryReset()  has been remotely called, the value\n(for the given language) will be reset to an empty string.  In order to conserve memory a single shared buffer machineIdVars\nis used for both the AppId and DeviceId fields.  Implementation and provisioning information  The bit field values in the example are an implementation of\nthe About feature and Configuration service framework per the About Interface Definition  and Configuration Interface Definition .\nYou should not require any change in these and only alter\nthe String values of the fields. You may of course remove\noptional fields such as DateOfManufacture.  Depending on the  AJSVC_PROPERTY_STORE_NUMBER_OF_LANGUAGES \nyou've provisioned, this structure must be populated with as\nmany default values. Use NULL for non-provisioned values such\nas when the field is non-language dependent (e.g., DeviceName).  When provisioning a non-language dependent field, the first\nvalue (at index  AJSVC_PROPERTY_STORE_NO_LANGUAGE_INDEX ) is\nused and all other values are ignored, yet must be initialized.  Adding custom field definition and values  Complete the following steps to add your own custom fields.   Decide to which subset the field belongs and add it to the enumeration AJSVC_PropertyStoreFieldIndices  accordingly.  Add a new field entry at the respective index to the propertyStoreProperties.  Decide whether the field is publicly accessible from\nremote clients. If the field is public, set the  mode7Public  bit to 1.  Decide whether the field is to be allowed to be configured\nremotely through the Configuration service framework. If the\nfield is updateable, then set the  mode0Write  bit to 1.\n    NOTE:  If you set this bit, the field's index must be included\n   in the Persisted or Config keys subsets.  Decide whether the field is to be includedin the Announcement.\nIf the field is announced, then set the  mode1Announce  bit to 1.\n   NOTE:  It is recommended to limit the inclusion of a field in\n  the Announcement according to its immediate relevance to the\n  relevant service framework's discovery. Only the value associated\n  with the currentDefaultLanguage will be sent in the Announcement.  Decide whether the field is multi-language and add the relevant\nvalues for the provisioned languages. If the field is multi-language,\nthen set the  mode2MultiLng  bit to\n1.  Decide whether the field is to be provisioned dynamically\nin code and persisted during first-time (or post-factory reset)\ndevice startup. If the field is to be initialized once, then\nset the  mode3Init  bit to 1 and add the relevant code to initialize it.   Refer to PropertyStore.c  PropertyStore_Init()  and\n    InitMandatoryPropertiesInRAM()  for an example setup\n   for the DeviceId and AppId fields.  NOTE:  If you set this bit, the field's index must be\n  included in the Persisted keys subsets.\n8. Add relevant validation of updated value for your custom\nkey by modifying the default implementation of  IsValueValid() \nin ConfigSample.c file.\n    c\n   uint8_t IsValueValid(const char* key, const char* value) {return TRUE;} \n9. Add entry in corresponding index of  propertyStoreDefaultValues \nto provision default value(s).\n10. Add entry in corresponding index of  propertyStoreRuntimeValues \nto provision for runtime value(s) buffer(s).  NOTE:  The example implementation of PropertyStore supports\nproperties with value of type String ('s') only. If your\nproperty must be of a different type, you must provision the\ndefault value as a String and perform the relevant de/serialization\non the client side.  The following shows an example of how to add a configurable\nproprietary property named \"MyProperty\" that has a language-dependent value.\n* Add index MyProperty to  AJSVC_PropertyStoreFieldIndices :  c\n  MyProperty, AJSVC_PROPERTY_STORE_NUMBER_OF_RUNTIME_KEYS,   Add a new entry to the  propertyStoreProperties  array in\nthe index which corresponds to the enumeration value defined above:   c\n  //{ \"Key Name \", W, A, M, I .. . . ., P },\n  { \"MyProperty\",   1, 0, 1, 0, 0, 0, 0, 1 },\n  // Add other configurable keys above this line   Add a new entry to the  propertyStoreDefaultValues  array\nin the index which corresponds to the enumeration value defined above:   c\n  static const char DEFAULT_MYPROPERTY_LANG1[] = \"My\";\n  static const char DEFAULT_MYPROPERTY_LANG2[] = \"Mein\";\n  static const char* DEFAULT_MYPROPERTIES[] =\n  { DEFAULT_ MYPROPERTY_LANG1, DEFAULT_ MYPROPERTY_LANG2 };\n  ...\n  DEFAULT_MYPROPERTIES, /*MyProperty*/\n  // Add other configurable keys above this line  Implement remote callbacks  Callbacks are provided by the service frameworks to allow for\nthe application writer to react to various remotely initiated\ncalls and events. In particular, the Configuration service\nframework has callbacks that allow for the application writer\nto react to remote initiated events and the Controlee part\nof the Control Panel service framework has callbacks that allow\nfor the application writer to write the business logic for the ControlPanel model.  See the  Configuration API Guide  and the Control Panel API Guide , respectively, for more information.  Integrate the Configuration service framework with an  application's AuthListener (optional)  The Configuration service framework and other AllJoyn service\nframework interface methods and signals require a secure\nAllJoyn connection. The application writer may choose to use\nan ALLJOYN_ECDHE_PSK authentication mechanism in its AuthListener implementation.  The Configuration service framework enables remote setting\nof a password that can be used as the secret for a key exchange\nauthentication mechanism. An example implementation that uses\nthis facility is included in the sample server application in\nthe ServicesHandlers.c file as shown below.  uint32_t PasswordCallback(uint8_t* buffer, uint32_t bufLen)\n{\n   AJ_Status status = AJ_OK;\n   const char* hexPassword;\n   size_t hexPasswordLen;\n   uint32_t len = 0;\n\n   hexPassword = AJSVC_PropertyStore_GetValue(AJSVC_PROPERTY_STORE_PASSCODE);\n   if (hexPassword == NULL) {\n      AJ_ErrPrintf(( Password is NULL!\\n ));\n      return len;\n   }\n   AJ_InfoPrintf(( Retrieved password=%s\\n , hexPassword));\n   hexPasswordLen = strlen(hexPassword);\n   len = hexPasswordLen / 2;\n   status = AJ_HexToRaw(hexPassword, hexPasswordLen, buffer, bufLen);\n   if (status == AJ_ERR_RESOURCES) {\n      len = 0;\n   }\n\n   return len;\n}  The above implementation calls AJSVC_PropertyStore_GetValue ( AJSVC_PROPERTY_STORE_PASSCODE )\nto retrieve the current password. This implementation relies on an\nextension in the sample implementation of the PropertyStore which\nwas extended with the Passcode field defined in the AJSVC_PropertyStoreFieldIndices  enumeration. The field is remotely\nupdateable via a Configuration service framework session using the\ndedicated  SetPasscode()  method. The stored Passcode is limited\nto the size of 65, allowing for 64 characters long secret:  #define PASSWORD_VALUE_LENGTH 65  This is achieved using the field definition that masks the\nfield as writable yet private, as shown in the  propertyStoreProperties \ninitialization in PropertyStore.c:  { Passcode , 1, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0 }  The default value is provisioned in ServerSample.c as follows:  // HEX encoded { '0', '0', '0', '0', '0', '0' }\nstatic const char* DEFAULT_PASSCODES[] = {  303030303030  };  and added to  propertyStoreDefaultValues .  DEFAULT_PASSCODES,\n/*Passcode*/  Since the Passcode enumeration value is less than  AJSVC_PROPERTY_STORE_NUMBER_OF_RUNTIME_KEYS ,\nit is also considered part of the  propertyStoreRuntimeValues ;\nits modified value is persisted.  Also, when  SetPasscode()  is called remotely, the  SetPasscode() \ncallback is invoked with the following example implementation in\nConfigSample.c file as shown below:  static AJ_Status SetPasscode(const char* daemonRealm, const uint8_t* newPasscode, uint8_t newPasscodeLen)\n{\n   AJ_Status status = AJ_OK;\n\n   char newStringPasscode[PASSWORD_VALUE_LENGTH + 1];\n   status = AJ_RawToHex(newPasscode, newPasscodeLen, newStringPasscode, sizeof(newStringPasscode), FALSE);\n   if (status != AJ_OK) {\n      return status;\n   }\n   if (AJSVC_PropertyStore_SetValue(AJSVC_PROPERTY_STORE_REALM_NAME, daemonRealm)  AJSVC_PropertyStore_SetValue(AJSVC_PROPERTY_STORE_PASSCODE, newStringPasscode))\n{\n\n      status = AJSVC_PropertyStore_SaveAll();\n      if (status != AJ_OK) {\n         return status;\n      }\n      AJ_ClearCredentials();\n      status = AJ_ERR_READ; //Force disconnect of AJ and services to refresh current sessions\n   } else {\n\n      status = AJSVC_PropertyStore_LoadAll();\n      if (status != AJ_OK) {\n         return status;\n      }\n   }\n\n   return status;\n}  The above implementation stores the passcode as part of the\nPropertyStore persistence:   It calls  AJSVC_PropertyStore_SetValue(Passcode, newStringPasscode) \nto set the value in RAM.  If successful, it also calls  AJSVC_PropertyStore_SaveAll() \nto persist to NVRAM.  Finally,  AJ_ClearCredentials()  is called to revoke all\ncurrent keys based on the old passcode.   NOTES \n* The stored passcode is HEX and is limited to the size of 32,\nallowing for 16 bytes long secret:  c\n  #define PASSWORD_VALUE_LENGTH (AJ_ADHOC_LEN * 2)   The default value for the Passcode field is provisioned as\n'303030303030' (the HEX encoded string value for the byte array\n{ '0', '0', '0', '0', '0', '0' }) as per the requirement outlined\nin the  Configuration Interface Definition .  The realm name is similarly persisted alongside the passcode\nby adding the RealmName field index to the  AJSVC_PropertyStoreFieldIndices \nenumeration and provisioning for it in  propertyStoreDefaultValues \nand  propertyStoreRuntimeValues  initialization.",

            "text": "My First AllJoyn\n Core Application\n\n\nCongratulations again on realizing that the AllJoyn framework will \nsolve all your proximity peer-to-peer issues. To better understand \nthe application that will be explained here, we will discuss an analogy \nthat should make understanding the AllJoyn framework clear.\n\n\nConcepts\n\n\nImagine you are in a room with lots of other people, a school \ncafeteria or public event. You have a group of people that you are \nwith that you want to interact with. There are many people around \nall making noise and talking and having conversations, being social. \nAn AllJoyn application is very much like a group setting. People in \na group can \"tell\" someone something, \"share\" something to the group, \nor \"broadcast\" something for everyone to hear.\n\n\nLet's look at the concept to \"Tell\" someone. We get a person's attention, \ndirect what we want to say directly at that person, and normally get a \nresponse. In the AllJoyn framework, this is the equivalent of joining a \nsession and executing a BusMethod call. We connect with another application, \nthen send what we want it to know, and get a response.\n\n\nThe concept of \"Share\" allows us to communicate with the group we are with. \nWhen you want to let each person in your group know something important, \nyou share with them by making an announcement. In the AllJoyn framework, \nthis equates to joining a session and sending a Signal. We don't want a \nresponse to our announcement, we just have meaningful data we want people \nin the group to know about at the same time.\n\n\nLastly, the idea of \"Broadcast\". When you want everyone in the room to \nhear what you have to say, regardless of who they are, we scream at the \ntop of our lungs something we feel is important. Some people will ignore \nthis, others will hear and take action, others will hear it and ignore our \nmessage. In the AllJoyn framework, we call this a \nSessionless Signal\n.\nThis allows for an application to publish some data that it feels is \nmeaningful across the network with a time to live expiration value. \nThat message can be picked up by any application that may be interested \nand there is no logic needed to track a sessionId, figure out who binds/joins; \nthe AllJoyn core handles this for you.\n\n\nOne thing that we have, as people, is the ability to see each other and \nrecognize certain characteristics like height, eye color, male/female, etc. \nWe also can recognize our friends in a crowed based on what they are wearing, etc.\n\nIn the AllJoyn framework, we discover other applications through the \nAbout Feature\n \nand this tells us characteristics about the device: name, make, model, etc. \nIt also tells us, very specifically, the set of interfaces that are supported.\n\nThese interfaces define the features that are exposed, and really the API set \nthat we can interact with.\n\n\nLet's get started building our first AllJoyn application by advertising our \ncapabilities, looking for other compatible applicaitons, and performing the \n3 communication paths: 1-to-1 interactions with a specific application, \n1-to-many to a specific set of applications, and 1-to-many with any application.\n\n\nBefore we get started writing code, follow the environment setup guide for your platform:\n\n\n\n \nLinux\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \nWindows\n\n\nNow that we have our environment set up, let's start writing some software!\n\n\nTutorial\n\n\nThe code for this tutorial can be found in the \nHackfest project\n.\n\n\nIn designing this sample application, we tried to seprate the \napplication into 3 sections of functinality to better aid in understanding.\n\n \nMain application code - main\n\n  * Handles the command line input\n  * Creates and places calls into the code that manages interactions with the AllJoyn APIs\n\n \nAllJoyn API code - MyAllJoynCode\n\n  * Shows how to initialize the AllJoyn framework\n  * Use the About Feature for service-level advertisement/discovery\n  * Binds a session and tracks hosted sessionId\n  * Tracks users on a sessionId\n  * Interacts with MyFirstBusObject to communicate with other AllJoyn entities\n* \nBusObject Implmentation - MyFirstBusObject\n\n  * Creates and implements an AllJoyn Interface\n  * Shows how to send a BusMethod and get a reply\n  * Shows how to send a Signal and Sessionless Signal\n  * Shows how to receive Signals\n\n\nNOTE: The code snippets are not complete by themselves and requires \nthe entire software to run. The snippets should be used as a reference \non how to use the AllJoyn APIs to help build an Application.\n\n\nEvery AllJoyn application creates a BusAttachment, starts it, \nand connects to an \nAllJoyn Router\n. The BusAttachment \nis the Object that allows you to use the AllJoyn APIs.\n\n\nmBusAttachment = new BusAttachment(\nMyFirstApplication\n, true);\n/* Start the msg bus */\nif (ER_OK == status) {\n    status = mBusAttachment-\nStart();\n} else {\n    printf(\nBusAttachment::Start failed\\n\n);\n}\n/* Connect to the daemon */\nif (ER_OK == status) {\n    status = mBusAttachment-\nConnect();\n    if (ER_OK != status) {\n        printf(\nBusAttachment Connect failed.\\n\n);\n    }\n}\n\n\n\n\nNow that the BusAttachment is set up, our next action is to decide \nwhat we want to do with the app. In this tutorial sample application, \nwe are going to be both a client and service side - a true peer on \nthe network.

It exposes \nthe API set that we implement.\n\n\nOur \nBusAttachment\n is created, started, and connected.  The connection setup \ndone, device details set, and the Object has been registered. Now let's make \nthe registration call so that we can find other \"first_app\" applications.\n\nJust making the API call is not enough, we need to explictly tell the AllJoyn \nframework that we are interested in receiving Sessionless signals.\n\n\n/* Now create a list of the interfaces used so that we can find just applications that use these interfaces */\nint len = interfacesUsed.size();\nconst char* interfaces[len];\nfor( int i = 0; i \n len; i++) {\n   interfaces[i] = interfacesUsed[i].c_str();\n}\n\n/*\n * Register this class to receive AllJoyn About feature annoucements from the services we care about.\n * This performs service level discovery\n */\nAnnouncementRegistrar::RegisterAnnounceHandler(*mBusAttachment, *this, interfaces, len);\n\n\n\n\nThe list of interfaces is supplied so that we have filtering and find \njust the applications that have the interface support that we can interact with.\n\n\nLastly, we need to tell the world about our existance.

This is where we will \nimplement our AllJoyn interface and expose it on a \nBusObject\n.\n\n\nIn designing this tutorial sample, we wanted to show a little variety of \nhow applications can interact.  We decided on a simple interface as follows:\n\n\nnode name=\n/my/first/busobject/communicate\n\n    \ninterface name=\norg.example.my.first.alljoyn.interface.communicate\n\n        \nmethod name=\nTell\n\n            \narg name=\nthought\n type=\ns\n direction=\nin\n/\n\n            \narg name=\nreply\n type=\ns\n direction=\nout\n/\n\n        \n/method\n\n        \nsignal name=\nShare\n\n            \narg name=\nthought\n type=\ns\n/\n\n        \n/signal\n\n        \nsignal name=\nBroadcast\n\n            \narg name=\nthought\n type=\ns\n/\n\n        \n/signal\n\n    \n/interface\n\n\n/node\n\n\n\n\n\nIn the above interface, Share and Broadcast are identical! Why did we do that? \nThis was to help express and show how signals can be sent on a single session \nor as a Sessionless signal.  The \"Share\" signal in this example could have been \nsent as a Sessionless signal to reduce the number of signals defined.  Similarly, \nthe Broadcast could have been used instead of \"Share\". But for the sake of simplicty \nand understanding, \"Share\" takes place in a group and \"Broadcast\" is available to the world.\n\n\nWe now have our interface defined so we can implement it in the software.\n\n\nstatic const char * MY_FIRST_OBJECT_PATH = \n/my/first/busobject/communicate\n;\nstatic const char * MY_FIRST_INTERFACE_NAMES[] = {\norg.example.my.first.alljoyn.interface.communicate\n};\nstatic const uint32_t MY_NUMBER_OF_INTERFACES = 1;\n...\n...\nQStatus status;\nInterfaceDescription* myFirstBusObjectIntf = NULL;\nif (!mBusAttachment.GetInterface(MY_FIRST_INTERFACE_NAMES[0])) {\n    status = mBusAttachment.CreateInterface(MY_FIRST_INTERFACE_NAMES[0], myFirstBusObjectIntf);\n\n    //Add BusMethods\n    myFirstBusObjectIntf-\nAddMethod(\nTell\n, \ns\n, \ns\n, \nthought,reply\n, 0);\n    myFirstBusObjectIntf-\nAddSignal(\nShare\n, \ns\n, \nthought\n, 0);// on a session\n    myFirstBusObjectIntf-\nAddSignal(\nBroadcast\n, \ns\n, \nthought\n, 0);\n\n    myFirstBusObjectIntf-\nActivate();\n}\n\n\n\n\nThe interface is now activated and ready to be used. We can now add it to our \nBusObject so that the AllJoyn framework knows that this object implements the above interface.\n\n\n/* Add the service interface to this object */\nconst InterfaceDescription* myFirstBusObjectTestIntf = mBusAttachment.GetInterface(MY_FIRST_INTERFACE_NAMES[0]);\nassert(myFirstBusObjectTestIntf);\nAddInterface(*myFirstBusObjectTestIntf);\n\n\n\n\nThe next step is to set up the method handlers for the BusMethod and the Signals \n(if used in your application).\n\n\n/* Set the local methods to which BusMethod linkage */\nconst MethodEntry methodEntries[] = {\n    { myFirstBusObjectTestIntf-\nGetMember(\nTell\n), static_cast\nMessageReceiver::MethodHandler\n(\nMyFirstBusObject::handleTell) },\n};\nstatus = AddMethodHandlers(methodEntries, sizeof(methodEntries)/sizeof(methodEntries[0])); \n\n/* Register the signal handlers */\nshareMember = myFirstBusObjectTestIntf-\nGetMember(\nShare\n);\nbroadcastMember = myFirstBusObjectTestIntf-\nGetMember(\nBroadcast\n);\nif (shareMember) {\n    status =  mBusAttachment.RegisterSignalHandler(this,\n        static_cast\nMessageReceiver::SignalHandler\n(\nMyFirstBusObject::shareHandler),\n        shareMember,\n        NULL);\n}\nif (broadcastMember) {\n    status =  mBusAttachment.RegisterSignalHandler(this,\n        static_cast\nMessageReceiver::SignalHandler\n(\nMyFirstBusObject::broadcastHandler),\n        broadcastMember,\n        NULL);\n}\n\n\n\n\nThe only thing missing now is in order to receive signals, much like \nwe had to do to receive the About Annoucement, we need to explictly \ntell the AllJoyn framework what we are interested in.\n\n\nstatic const char * MY_FIRST_ADD_MATCH_RULE = \ntype='signal',interface='org.example.my.first.alljoyn.interface.communicate'\n;\n...\n/* Make addMatch calls to complete the registration with the AllJoyn router */\nmBusAttachment.AddMatch(MY_FIRST_ADD_MATCH_RULE);\n...\n\n\n\n\nLastly, we implment the functions we assigned to handle the incoming responses.\n\n\nvoid MyFirstBusObject::handleTell(const InterfaceDescription::Member* member, Message\n msg)\n{\n    const char* receivedThought = msg-\nGetArg(0)-\nv_string.str;\n    printf(\nSomeone(%s) told you (%s)\\n\n, msg-\nGetSender(), receivedThought);\n\n    MsgArg reply;\n    reply.Set(\ns\n, \nYou're so funny!\n);\n    QStatus status = MethodReply(msg, \nreply, 1);\n    if (status == ER_OK) {\n        printf(\nYou let them know they are funny!\\n\n);\n    } else {\n        printf(\nAn error occured and they do not know that they are funny.\\n\n);\n    }\n}\nvoid MyFirstBusObject::shareHandler(const InterfaceDescription::Member* member, const char* srcPath, Message\n msg)\n{\n    const char* receivedThought = msg-\nGetArg(0)-\nv_string.str;\n    const char* fromUser = msg-\nGetSender();\n    printf(\nReceived shared thought (%s) from %s on sessionId %d\\n\n, receivedThought, fromUser, msg-\nGetSessionId());\n}\nvoid MyFirstBusObject::broadcastHandler(const InterfaceDescription::Member* member, const char* srcPath, Message\n msg)\n{\n    const char* receivedThought = msg-\nGetArg(0)-\nv_string.str;\n    const char* fromUser = msg-\nGetSender();\n    printf(\nReceived a broudcast thought (%s) from %s\\n\n, receivedThought, fromUser);\n}\n\n\n\n\nThe above methods will be automatically triggered by the AllJoyn framework \nwhen an AllJoyn message comes in that is intended for us when the receipt \nfactors are met. Specifically, we are in the same session that the \nSignal\n \nor BusMethod call came in on, or the \"Broadcast\" sessionless signal came in.\n\n\nThe last thing that this application needs is a the code to place the \nBusMethod\n \ncall or to send the \nSignals\n.\nTo execute a BusMethod call on another application, we need to create a \n\nProxyBusObject\n that represents that application's software. In order to \ndo this, we need the UniqueName of the other application, the sessionId that \nwe are joined into, and the Path that the object lives. In this example, \nwe have a fixed path of \"/my/first/busobject/communicate\".\n\n\nqcc::String MyFirstBusObject::doTell(qcc::String uniqueName, qcc::String thought, int sessionId)\n{\n    ProxyBusObject remoteObj = ProxyBusObject(*bus, uniqueName.c_str(), MY_FIRST_OBJECT_PATH, (SessionId)sessionId);    \n    remoteObj.AddInterface(MY_FIRST_INTERFACE_NAMES[0]);\n    Message reply(*bus);\n    MsgArg arg(\ns\n, thought.c_str());\n    QStatus status = remoteObj.MethodCall(MY_FIRST_INTERFACE_NAMES[0], \nTell\n, \narg, 1, reply);\n    if (ER_OK == status) {\n        return reply-\nGetArg(0)-\nv_string.str; \n    }\n    return \nERROR\n;\n}\n\n\n\n\nSending of a \nSignal\n is done through the \nBusObject\n's \nSignal\n method. \nWhat makes a signal bound to a session is by passing in a valid \nSessionId\n. \nWhat makes it a Sessionless Signal is by setting the flag that describes it as such.\n\n\nvoid MyFirstBusObject::doShare(qcc::String thought, int sessionId)\n{\n    MsgArg payload(\ns\n, thought.c_str());\n    uint8_t flags = 0;\n    Signal(NULL, sessionId, *shareMember, \npayload, 1, 0, flags);\n}\nvoid MyFirstBusObject::doBroadcast(qcc::String thought)\n{\n    MsgArg payload(\ns\n, thought.c_str());\n    uint8_t flags = ALLJOYN_FLAG_SESSIONLESS;\n    Signal(NULL, 0, *broadcastMember, \npayload, 1, 0, flags);\n}\n\n\n\n\nThese functions are nearly identical, but semantically VERY different. \nThe differences exist on who is eligible to receive the \"thought\".\n\nThe doShare method sends the Signal to just those who are joined together \nin a session. The doBroadcast method sends it to anyone who is interested and listening.\n\n\nWith the creation of the code to interact we now have everything set up \nfor the AllJoyn framework side of things. The remaining code in the tutorial \ndeals with tracking members who join a session via the \nSessionListener\n and \nhandling the command line input.",

There are many people around \nall making noise and talking and having conversations, being social. \nAn AllJoyn application is very much like a group setting. People in \na group can \"tell\" someone something, \"share\" something to the group, \nor \"broadcast\" something for everyone to hear.  Let's look at the concept to \"Tell\" someone. We get a person's attention, \ndirect what we want to say directly at that person, and normally get a \nresponse. In the AllJoyn framework, this is the equivalent of joining a \nsession and executing a BusMethod call. We connect with another application, \nthen send what we want it to know, and get a response.  The concept of \"Share\" allows us to communicate with the group we are with. \nWhen you want to let each person in your group know something important, \nyou share with them by making an announcement. In the AllJoyn framework, \nthis equates to joining a session and sending a Signal. We don't want a \nresponse to our announcement, we just have meaningful data we want people \nin the group to know about at the same time.  Lastly, the idea of \"Broadcast\". When you want everyone in the room to \nhear what you have to say, regardless of who they are, we scream at the \ntop of our lungs something we feel is important. Some people will ignore \nthis, others will hear and take action, others will hear it and ignore our \nmessage. In the AllJoyn framework, we call this a  Sessionless Signal .\nThis allows for an application to publish some data that it feels is \nmeaningful across the network with a time to live expiration value. \nThat message can be picked up by any application that may be interested \nand there is no logic needed to track a sessionId, figure out who binds/joins; \nthe AllJoyn core handles this for you.  One thing that we have, as people, is the ability to see each other and \nrecognize certain characteristics like height, eye color, male/female, etc. \nWe also can recognize our friends in a crowed based on what they are wearing, etc. \nIn the AllJoyn framework, we discover other applications through the  About Feature  \nand this tells us characteristics about the device: name, make, model, etc. \nIt also tells us, very specifically, the set of interfaces that are supported. \nThese interfaces define the features that are exposed, and really the API set \nthat we can interact with.  Let's get started building our first AllJoyn application by advertising our \ncapabilities, looking for other compatible applicaitons, and performing the \n3 communication paths: 1-to-1 interactions with a specific application, \n1-to-many to a specific set of applications, and 1-to-many with any application.  Before we get started writing code, follow the environment setup guide for your platform:    Linux      Windows  Now that we have our environment set up, let's start writing some software!",

The snippets should be used as a reference \non how to use the AllJoyn APIs to help build an Application.  Every AllJoyn application creates a BusAttachment, starts it, \nand connects to an  AllJoyn Router .

We decided on a simple interface as follows:  node name= /my/first/busobject/communicate \n     interface name= org.example.my.first.alljoyn.interface.communicate \n         method name= Tell \n             arg name= thought  type= s  direction= in / \n             arg name= reply  type= s  direction= out / \n         /method \n         signal name= Share \n             arg name= thought  type= s / \n         /signal \n         signal name= Broadcast \n             arg name= thought  type= s / \n         /signal \n     /interface  /node   In the above interface, Share and Broadcast are identical! Why did we do that? \nThis was to help express and show how signals can be sent on a single session \nor as a Sessionless signal.

But for the sake of simplicty \nand understanding, \"Share\" takes place in a group and \"Broadcast\" is available to the world.  We now have our interface defined so we can implement it in the software.  static const char * MY_FIRST_OBJECT_PATH =  /my/first/busobject/communicate ;\nstatic const char * MY_FIRST_INTERFACE_NAMES[] = { org.example.my.first.alljoyn.interface.communicate };\nstatic const uint32_t MY_NUMBER_OF_INTERFACES = 1;\n...\n...\nQStatus status;\nInterfaceDescription* myFirstBusObjectIntf = NULL;\nif (!mBusAttachment.GetInterface(MY_FIRST_INTERFACE_NAMES[0])) {\n    status = mBusAttachment.CreateInterface(MY_FIRST_INTERFACE_NAMES[0], myFirstBusObjectIntf);\n\n    //Add BusMethods\n    myFirstBusObjectIntf- AddMethod( Tell ,  s ,  s ,  thought,reply , 0);\n    myFirstBusObjectIntf- AddSignal( Share ,  s ,  thought , 0);// on a session\n    myFirstBusObjectIntf- AddSignal( Broadcast ,  s ,  thought , 0);\n\n    myFirstBusObjectIntf- Activate();\n}  The interface is now activated and ready to be used. We can now add it to our \nBusObject so that the AllJoyn framework knows that this object implements the above interface.  /* Add the service interface to this object */\nconst InterfaceDescription* myFirstBusObjectTestIntf = mBusAttachment.GetInterface(MY_FIRST_INTERFACE_NAMES[0]);\nassert(myFirstBusObjectTestIntf);\nAddInterface(*myFirstBusObjectTestIntf);  The next step is to set up the method handlers for the BusMethod and the Signals \n(if used in your application).  /* Set the local methods to which BusMethod linkage */\nconst MethodEntry methodEntries[] = {\n    { myFirstBusObjectTestIntf- GetMember( Tell ), static_cast MessageReceiver::MethodHandler ( MyFirstBusObject::handleTell) },\n};\nstatus = AddMethodHandlers(methodEntries, sizeof(methodEntries)/sizeof(methodEntries[0])); \n\n/* Register the signal handlers */\nshareMember = myFirstBusObjectTestIntf- GetMember( Share );\nbroadcastMember = myFirstBusObjectTestIntf- GetMember( Broadcast );\nif (shareMember) {\n    status =  mBusAttachment.RegisterSignalHandler(this,\n        static_cast MessageReceiver::SignalHandler ( MyFirstBusObject::shareHandler),\n        shareMember,\n        NULL);\n}\nif (broadcastMember) {\n    status =  mBusAttachment.RegisterSignalHandler(this,\n        static_cast MessageReceiver::SignalHandler ( MyFirstBusObject::broadcastHandler),\n        broadcastMember,\n        NULL);\n}  The only thing missing now is in order to receive signals, much like \nwe had to do to receive the About Annoucement, we need to explictly \ntell the AllJoyn framework what we are interested in.  static const char * MY_FIRST_ADD_MATCH_RULE =  type='signal',interface='org.example.my.first.alljoyn.interface.communicate' ;\n...\n/* Make addMatch calls to complete the registration with the AllJoyn router */\nmBusAttachment.AddMatch(MY_FIRST_ADD_MATCH_RULE);\n...  Lastly, we implment the functions we assigned to handle the incoming responses.  void MyFirstBusObject::handleTell(const InterfaceDescription::Member* member, Message  msg)\n{\n    const char* receivedThought = msg- GetArg(0)- v_string.str;\n    printf( Someone(%s) told you (%s)\\n , msg- GetSender(), receivedThought);\n\n    MsgArg reply;\n    reply.Set( s ,  You're so funny! );\n    QStatus status = MethodReply(msg,  reply, 1);\n    if (status == ER_OK) {\n        printf( You let them know they are funny!\\n );\n    } else {\n        printf( An error occured and they do not know that they are funny.\\n );\n    }\n}\nvoid MyFirstBusObject::shareHandler(const InterfaceDescription::Member* member, const char* srcPath, Message  msg)\n{\n    const char* receivedThought = msg- GetArg(0)- v_string.str;\n    const char* fromUser = msg- GetSender();\n    printf( Received shared thought (%s) from %s on sessionId %d\\n , receivedThought, fromUser, msg- GetSessionId());\n}\nvoid MyFirstBusObject::broadcastHandler(const InterfaceDescription::Member* member, const char* srcPath, Message  msg)\n{\n    const char* receivedThought = msg- GetArg(0)- v_string.str;\n    const char* fromUser = msg- GetSender();\n    printf( Received a broudcast thought (%s) from %s\\n , receivedThought, fromUser);\n}  The above methods will be automatically triggered by the AllJoyn framework \nwhen an AllJoyn message comes in that is intended for us when the receipt \nfactors are met. Specifically, we are in the same session that the  Signal  \nor BusMethod call came in on, or the \"Broadcast\" sessionless signal came in.  The last thing that this application needs is a the code to place the  BusMethod  \ncall or to send the  Signals .\nTo execute a BusMethod call on another application, we need to create a  ProxyBusObject  that represents that application's software. In order to \ndo this, we need the UniqueName of the other application, the sessionId that \nwe are joined into, and the Path that the object lives. In this example, \nwe have a fixed path of \"/my/first/busobject/communicate\".  qcc::String MyFirstBusObject::doTell(qcc::String uniqueName, qcc::String thought, int sessionId)\n{\n    ProxyBusObject remoteObj = ProxyBusObject(*bus, uniqueName.c_str(), MY_FIRST_OBJECT_PATH, (SessionId)sessionId);    \n    remoteObj.AddInterface(MY_FIRST_INTERFACE_NAMES[0]);\n    Message reply(*bus);\n    MsgArg arg( s , thought.c_str());\n    QStatus status = remoteObj.MethodCall(MY_FIRST_INTERFACE_NAMES[0],  Tell ,  arg, 1, reply);\n    if (ER_OK == status) {\n        return reply- GetArg(0)- v_string.str; \n    }\n    return  ERROR ;\n}  Sending of a  Signal  is done through the  BusObject 's  Signal  method. \nWhat makes a signal bound to a session is by passing in a valid  SessionId . \nWhat makes it a Sessionless Signal is by setting the flag that describes it as such.  void MyFirstBusObject::doShare(qcc::String thought, int sessionId)\n{\n    MsgArg payload( s , thought.c_str());\n    uint8_t flags = 0;\n    Signal(NULL, sessionId, *shareMember,  payload, 1, 0, flags);\n}\nvoid MyFirstBusObject::doBroadcast(qcc::String thought)\n{\n    MsgArg payload( s , thought.c_str());\n    uint8_t flags = ALLJOYN_FLAG_SESSIONLESS;\n    Signal(NULL, 0, *broadcastMember,  payload, 1, 0, flags);\n}  These functions are nearly identical, but semantically VERY different. \nThe differences exist on who is eligible to receive the \"thought\". \nThe doShare method sends the Signal to just those who are joined together \nin a session. The doBroadcast method sends it to anyone who is interested and listening.  With the creation of the code to interact we now have everything set up \nfor the AllJoyn framework side of things. The remaining code in the tutorial \ndeals with tracking members who join a session via the  SessionListener  and \nhandling the command line input.",

The interfaces are \nimplemented by port objects that support audio/\n capabilities.\n\n\nFIFO control\n\n\nAn audio sink exposes a FIFO to receive streamed data from an \naudio source. Control of the FIFO is implemented as a state machine. \nThe following figure illustrates the states of the FIFO.\n\n\n\n\nFigure:\n Audio sink diagram\n\n\nFilling an audio sink's FIFO is accomplished using the Data \nsignal, FifoSize and FifoPosition properties, and FifoPositionChanged \nsignal. On receipt of each FifoPositionChanged signal, the audio \nsource can send (FifoSize - FifoPosition) more bytes of data. \nThe audio source should not send more than this; doing so can \nlead to blocking the receipt of other BusMethods and BusSignals \nby the audio sink, or the audio sink discarding the data.\n\n\nUse the Flush method to tell the audio sink to discard all the \ndata in its FIFO in preparation for new data.\n\n\nSynchronization\n\n\nIf an audio sink supports synchronized playback (by implementing \nthe Stream.Clock interface), use the timestamp parameter of the \nData signal to determine the correct time to render the data. \nThe audio source computes a timestamp sufficient to ensure that \nit is greater than the network latency plus the rendering latency \nof each audio sink. Audio sinks should discard data that cannot \nbe rendered in time.\n\n\nStream.Port.AudioSink interface\n\n\nInterface name\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nInterface name\n\n\nVersion\n\n\nSecured\n\n\nObject path\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\norg.alljoyn.Stream.Port.AudioSink\n\n\n1\n\n\nno\n\n\nChild node of node implementing the Stream interface.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nProperties\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nProperty name\n\n\nSignature\n\n\nList of values\n\n\nRead/Write\n\n\nDescription\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nVersion\n\n\nq\n\n\nPositive integers\n\n\nRead-only\n\n\nInterface version number\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFifoSize\n\n\nu\n\n\nSize in bytes\n\n\nRead-only\n\n\nThe size of the sink's FIFO in bytes.

The interfaces are \nimplemented by port objects that support audio/  capabilities.  FIFO control  An audio sink exposes a FIFO to receive streamed data from an \naudio source. Control of the FIFO is implemented as a state machine. \nThe following figure illustrates the states of the FIFO.   Figure:  Audio sink diagram  Filling an audio sink's FIFO is accomplished using the Data \nsignal, FifoSize and FifoPosition properties, and FifoPositionChanged \nsignal. On receipt of each FifoPositionChanged signal, the audio \nsource can send (FifoSize - FifoPosition) more bytes of data. \nThe audio source should not send more than this; doing so can \nlead to blocking the receipt of other BusMethods and BusSignals \nby the audio sink, or the audio sink discarding the data.  Use the Flush method to tell the audio sink to discard all the \ndata in its FIFO in preparation for new data.  Synchronization  If an audio sink supports synchronized playback (by implementing \nthe Stream.Clock interface), use the timestamp parameter of the \nData signal to determine the correct time to render the data. \nThe audio source computes a timestamp sufficient to ensure that \nit is greater than the network latency plus the rendering latency \nof each audio sink. Audio sinks should discard data that cannot \nbe rendered in time.",

            "text": "Control Panel Interface Definition - 14.02\n\n\nWarning: This is not the latest interface definition.\n\n\nGo here for latest Control Panel Interface Definition\n\n\nIntroduction\n\n\nPurpose\n\n\nThis document describes the specification of the Control Panel \nservice framework's collection of interfaces. Implementing these \ninterfaces provides the Control Panel service framework a mechanism \nto allow for a controller application like the AllJoyn\n On \napplication to render the UI based on the controllee application's \nwidget metadata. The controller application does not know the \nsemantics of the remote widgets. It relies on the end user to understand\nand perform the actions on the rendered user interface. A typical \naction is selecting a field or pressing a button.\n\n\nScope\n\n\nThis document is targeted to developers of AllJoyn applications \nwho want to build controller and controllee applications without \nusing the tools provided by the Control Panel service framework.\n\n\nReferences\n\n\nExcept for supporting information, the following are reference \ndocuments found on the AllSeen Alliance web site's Docs/Downloads section.\n\n\n\n\nAllJoyn\n Framework Tutorial\n\n\nIntroduction to AllJoyn\n Thin Client\n\n\nAllJoyn Data Type Signature\n\n\nRFC3339: (Date and Time on the Internet: Timestamps)\n\n\n\n\nAcronyms and terms\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTerm\n\n\nDefinition\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAllJoyn device\n\n\nA device that supports the AllJoyn framework and can connect to a personal network.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nControl panel\n\n\nCollection of Widgets that allow a user to interact with a device. A control panel is defined and announced by a Controllee; and discovered and displayed Control panel by a Controller. A device can have more than one, and can be defined on a per-language basis.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nControllee\n\n\nAn AllJoyn application that advertises its Control Panel interfaces, so that other AllJoyn devices may control it.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nController\n\n\nAn AllJoyn application that controls another AllJoyn device that advertises its Control Panel interfaces.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSpecification Overview\n\n\nThe Control Panel interfaces must be implemented by an \napplication on a controllee. Figure 1 illustrates \nthe relationship between a controllee app and a controller app.\n\n\n\n\nFigure: Control Panel service framework architecture within \nthe AllJoyn\n framework\n\n\nThe OEM is responsible for writing the Control interfaces and \nthe Control Panel service framework metadata.\n\n\nThe UI Toolkit Adaption Layer, a library used to map the metadata \nto platform-specific UI elements, is made available as part of the \nControl Panel service framework release.\n\n\nDiscovery\n\n\nControllees are discovered via an AllJoyn announcement. Each AllJoyn \ndevice uses the About feature to announce basic app information like \napp name, device name, manufacturer, and model number. The announcement \nalso contains the list of object paths and service interfaces to allow \nthe controller to determine whether the controllee provides \nfunctionality of interest.\n\n\nThe About announcement is propagated using a sessionless signal.\n\n\nCall Flows\n\n\nStatic Control Panel flow\n\n\nFigure 2 illustrates a typical call flow for a control \npanel that does not change once rendered.\n\n\n\n\nFigure: Static Control Panel call flow\n\n\nDynamic Control Panel flow\n\n\nFigure 3 illustrates a call flow for a control panel that \nchanges as the end user interacts with the widgets.\n\n\n\n\nFigure: Dynamic Control Panel call flow\n\n\nError Handling\n\n\nThe method calls in the Control Panel interfaces use the AllJoyn \nerror message handling feature (ER_BUS_REPLY_IS_ERROR_MESSAGE) \nto set the error name and error message.\n\n\nTable 1 lists the possible errors raised by the Control Panel service framework interfaces.\n\n\nTable 1: Control Panel service framework interface errors\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nError name\n\n\nError message\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\norg.alljoyn.Error.OutOfRange\n\n\nValue out of range\n\n\n\n\n\n\norg.alljoyn.Error.InvalidState\n\n\nInvalid state\n\n\n\n\n\n\norg.alljoyn.Error.InvalidProperty\n\n\nInvalid property\n\n\n\n\n\n\norg.alljoyn.Error.InvalidValue\n\n\nInvalid value\n\n\n\n\n\n\norg.alljoyn.Error.MethodNotAllowed\n\n\nMethod call not allowed\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nBusObject Map\n\n\nBusObject structure\n\n\nFigure 4 shows the tree structure diagram that \nrepresents the basic organization of AllJoyn objects used in \nthe support of the Control Panel service framework. A control \npanel is implemented using several AllJoyn objects.\n\n\n\n\nFigure: BusObject map\n\n\nThe objects are organized to support multiple units and multiple \nlanguages. Only the top-level panels should be listed in the announcement.\n\n\nSince the IETF language tag allows for hyphen (-) which is not \nallowed in the bus object path, any language tag in the object \npath replaces a hyphen (-) with an underscore (_).\n\n\nIn addition to the control panels, the Control Panel service \nframework can also support other panels such as a notification \npanel. These panels are not required to be advertised in the announcement.\n\n\nIt is the controller's job to introspect and walk the object \ntree of a control panel to retrieve all the metadata for that \ncontrol panel.\n\n\nBusObject map examples\n\n\nThe following subsections illustrate a few sample BusObject map structures.\n\n\nWashing machine example\n\n\nFigure 5 illustrates a sample bus object map for a washing machine.\n\n\n\n\nFigure: Washing machine example\n\n\nSprinkler system example\n\n\nFigure 6 illustrates a sample bus object map for a sprinkler system.\n\n\n\n\nFigure: Sprinkler system example\n\n\nControl Panel Service Framework Interfaces\n\n\nThe Control Panel service framework comprises a set of interfaces \nas illustrated in Figure 4.\n\n\nControlPanel Interface\n\n\nThis interface indicates whether the object is a control panel. \nThis object will support at least one language. The service only \nneeds to advertise this type of object in the About announcement. \nNo other objects in the Control Panel service framework tree \nshould be announced.\n\n\nNOTE: It's the responsibility of the controller to introspect \nthe children objects to locate the corresponding root container \nof the given panel for the specific language code.\n\n\nInterface name\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nInterface name\n\n\nVersion\n\n\nSecured\n\n\nObject path\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\norg.alljoyn.ControlPanel.ControlPanel\n\n\n1\n\n\nno\n\n\n/ControlPanel/{unit)/{panelName}\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nExample: /ControlPanel/washing/consolePanel\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nProperties\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nProperty name\n\n\nSignature\n\n\nList of values\n\n\nWritable\n\n\nDescription\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nVersion\n\n\nq\n\n\nPositive integers\n\n\nno\n\n\nInterface version number\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nIntrospect XML\n\n\nThe following XML defines the ControlPanel interface.\n\n\nnode xmlns:xsi=\nhttp://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema-instance\n\n      xsi:noNamespaceSchemaLocation=\nhttps://www.allseenalliance.org/schemas/introspect.xsd\n\n   \ninterface name=\norg.alljoyn.ControlPanel.ControlPanel\n\n      \nproperty name=\nVersion\n type=\nq\n access=\nread\n/\n\n   \n/interface\n\n\n/node\n\n\n\n\n\nContainer Interface\n\n\nThis interface provides all the metadata to guide the \ncontroller to render the UI for a container widget.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nInterface name\n\n\nVersion\n\n\nSecured\n\n\nObject path\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\norg.alljoyn.ControlPanel.Container\n\n\n1\n\n\nno\n\n\n/ControlPanel/{unit)/{panelName}/{language}/.../{containerName}\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nExamples:\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n/ControlPanel/washing/consolePanel/en\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n/ControlPanel/sprinkler/mainPanel/en/Schedules/InputForm/RunOnDays\n\n\n\n\n\n\norg.alljoyn.ControlPanel.SecuredContainer\n\n\n1\n\n\nyes\n\n\n/ControlPanel/{unit)/{panelName}/{language}/.../{containerName}\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nProperties\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nProperty name\n\n\nSignature\n\n\nList of values\n\n\nWritable\n\n\nDescription\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nVersion\n\n\nq\n\n\nPositive integers\n\n\nno\n\n\nInterface version number\n\n\n\n\n\n\nStates\n\n\nu\n\n\nBit mask\n\n\nno\n\n\nBit mask for various widget states\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nMask\n / \nName\n / \nDescription\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n0x01 / enabled / Indicates whether the widget is enabled.

Implementing these \ninterfaces provides the Control Panel service framework a mechanism \nto allow for a controller application like the AllJoyn  On \napplication to render the UI based on the controllee application's \nwidget metadata. The controller application does not know the \nsemantics of the remote widgets. It relies on the end user to understand\nand perform the actions on the rendered user interface. A typical \naction is selecting a field or pressing a button.  Scope  This document is targeted to developers of AllJoyn applications \nwho want to build controller and controllee applications without \nusing the tools provided by the Control Panel service framework.

In addition to the control panels, the Control Panel service \nframework can also support other panels such as a notification \npanel. These panels are not required to be advertised in the announcement.  It is the controller's job to introspect and walk the object \ntree of a control panel to retrieve all the metadata for that \ncontrol panel.

The Sessionless signal sessionless signals are broadcast on the network until an associated time-to-live (TTL) value expires. The Notification service framework sends notification messages as sessionless signals over the Wi-Fi network.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nOverview\n\n\nThis document captures the design for the Notification service framework, \nwhich is a software layer that enables AllJoyn\n devices \nto send notifications to other AllJoyn devices. These devices \nare categorized as producers and consumers. Producers produce \nand send notifications, while consumers consume and display \nthese notifications. An end user's home (Wi-Fi) network can \nhave multiple producers connected and generating notification \nmessages, as well as multiple consumers connected and consuming \nthese messages.\n\n\nThe Notification service framework design supports text \nnotification payload as well as rich notification media \n(icon and audio). For rich media, the notification message \npayload can include URL links or AllJoyn object path references \nto rich notification media. The consumer app receiving the \nnotification message will fetch the rich notification media \nfrom the object path or the producer device.\n\n\nThe Notification service framework uses the AllJoyn framework \nsessionless signal to deliver notification messages. The \nNotification service framework exposes the Notification Service \nAPI for application developers to deliver and receive notification \nmessages. The device OEM uses the Notification service framework \nProducer API to send notification messages. The Notification \nservice framework sends these notification messages over the \nAllJoyn sessionless signal transport mechanism and makes them \navailable to consumer devices listening for sessionless signals. \nThe consumer running the Notification service framework registers \nwith the AllJoyn framework to receive notification messages. \nThe application developer for the consumer device uses the \nNotification service framework Consumer API to register and \nreceive notifications from any producer that is sending \nnotification on the Wi-Fi network.\n\n\nArchitecture\n\n\nThe Notification service framework implements the Notification \ninterface which is the over-the-wire interface to deliver messages \nfrom producers to consumers. Application developers making use of \nthe Notification service framework implement against the\nNotification service framework APIs (producer and consumer side). \nThey do not implement the Notification interface.\n\n\nFigure 1 illustrates the Notification service \nframework API and Notification interface on producers and consumers.\n\n\n\n\nFigure: Notification service framework architecture within the AllJoyn framework\n\n\nTypical call flow\n\n\nFigure 2 illustrates a typical Notification service \nframework call flow with a single producer app generating a notification \nmessage. The message is then acquired by two consumer apps on the \nAllJoyn network.\n\n\n\n\nFigure: Typical Notification service framework call flow\n\n\nThe AllJoyn framework on the producer device does a sessionless \nsignal broadcast for the notification message. This is received \nby the AllJoyn framework on the consumer devices. The AllJoyn \nframework then fetches the notification message over unicast \nsession from the producer AllJoyn core and delivers to the \nconsumer application.\n\n\nSpecification\n\n\nNotification messages\n\n\nThe notification message comprises a set of fields including \nmessage type and message TTL. These notification fields are \nspecified by the producer app when sending notification message \nas part of Notification service framework Producer API.\n\n\nMessage type and TTL fields\n\n\nThe message type defines the type of notification messages \n(emergency, warning and information). Multiple types of \nnotification messages can be sent at the same time by a producer. \nThe message TTL defines the validity period of the notification message.\nNotification messages can be received by consumers that connect \nduring the defined message TTL value.\n\n\nMessages with the same message type will overwrite each other \non the producer, so a consumer that connects to the network \nafter the notification was sent will receive only the last \nof each message type.\n\n\nNotification message behavior\n\n\nThe following behavior is supported using the Notification \nservice framework.\n\n\n\n\nIf another notification message of the same message type \nis sent by a producer app within the TTL period, the new message \noverwrites the existing message.\n\n\nIf a consumer connects to the network after the TTL period \nexpires, that consumer will not receive the message. For example, \nwhen a consumer such as a mobile phone is on the home network \nand the end user leaves the home; the consumer is no longer on \nthe home network. The mobile phone will not receive notification \nmessages when it reacquires the home network and the TTL of \nthose notifications have expired.\n\n\n\n\nNOTE: The value is only used for message validity on the producer \ndevice. The TTL field is not sent as part of the notification \nmessage payload data over the end user's home network.\n\n\nSee \nNotification Service Framework Use Cases\n \nfor use case scenarios related to notification message behavior.\n\n\nDismissing a notification\n\n\nThe dismiss notification is an option for consumers that have \nreceived the notification to let the producer know that this \nnotification has been seen and there is no need to continue \nsending. It also lets other consumers know that the notification \ncan be removed from the user display.\n\n\nWhen a consumer attempts to dismiss a notification, the service \nframework creates a session with the producer using the original \nsender field sent in the notification.\n\n\nUsing the original sender field confirms that the notification \nis received by the actual producer and not the super agent in \ncase the consumer received the notification from the super agent.\n\n\nThe producer will then send out a dismiss sessionless signal \nto notify the rest of the consumers in the network that this \nnotification has been dismissed.\n\n\nIf the producer is not reachable, the consumer will send out \nthe dismiss sessionless signal on its own.\n\n\nNotification Interface\n\n\nThe Notification interface is announced such that when a \ndevice scans the network, it can find all producer devices.\n\n\nInterface name\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nInterface name\n\n\nVersion\n\n\nSecured\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\norg.alljoyn.Notification\n\n\n1\n\n\nno\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nProperties\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nProperty name\n\n\nSignature\n\n\nList of values\n\n\nWritable\n\n\nDescription\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nVersion\n\n\nq\n\n\nPositive integers\n\n\nno\n\n\nInterface version number\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSignals\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSignal name\n\n\nParameters\n\n\nSessionless\n\n\nDescription\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nName\n / \nSignature\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNotify\n\n\n(listed below)\n\n\nyes\n\n\nAllJoyn signal carrying notification message.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nnotifMsg / q\n\n\nSee \nData types\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nData types\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSignature\n\n\nDefinition\n\n\nSignature\n\n\nDescription\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nnotificationMsg\n\n\nversion\n\n\nshort\n\n\nVersion of the Notification protocol.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nmsgId\n\n\ninteger\n\n\nUnique identification assigned to the notification message by the Notification service framework.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nmsgType\n\n\nshort\n\n\nType of notification message.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n* 0 - Emergency\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n* 1 - Warning\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n* 2 - Information\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\ndeviceId\n\n\nstring\n\n\nGlobally unique identifier for a given AllJoyn-enabled device.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\ndeviceName\n\n\nstring\n\n\nName for a given AllJoyn-enabled device.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nappId\n\n\narray of bytes\n\n\nGlobally unique identifier for a given AllJoyn application.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nappName\n\n\nstring\n\n\nName for a given AllJoyn-enabled device.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nList\n\n\nattributes\n\n\nSet of attribute and value pair.

            "text": "This document captures the design for the Notification service framework, \nwhich is a software layer that enables AllJoyn  devices \nto send notifications to other AllJoyn devices. These devices \nare categorized as producers and consumers. Producers produce \nand send notifications, while consumers consume and display \nthese notifications. An end user's home (Wi-Fi) network can \nhave multiple producers connected and generating notification \nmessages, as well as multiple consumers connected and consuming \nthese messages.  The Notification service framework design supports text \nnotification payload as well as rich notification media \n(icon and audio). For rich media, the notification message \npayload can include URL links or AllJoyn object path references \nto rich notification media. The consumer app receiving the \nnotification message will fetch the rich notification media \nfrom the object path or the producer device.  The Notification service framework uses the AllJoyn framework \nsessionless signal to deliver notification messages. The \nNotification service framework exposes the Notification Service \nAPI for application developers to deliver and receive notification \nmessages. The device OEM uses the Notification service framework \nProducer API to send notification messages. The Notification \nservice framework sends these notification messages over the \nAllJoyn sessionless signal transport mechanism and makes them \navailable to consumer devices listening for sessionless signals. \nThe consumer running the Notification service framework registers \nwith the AllJoyn framework to receive notification messages. \nThe application developer for the consumer device uses the \nNotification service framework Consumer API to register and \nreceive notifications from any producer that is sending \nnotification on the Wi-Fi network.  Architecture  The Notification service framework implements the Notification \ninterface which is the over-the-wire interface to deliver messages \nfrom producers to consumers. Application developers making use of \nthe Notification service framework implement against the\nNotification service framework APIs (producer and consumer side). \nThey do not implement the Notification interface.  Figure 1 illustrates the Notification service \nframework API and Notification interface on producers and consumers.

The message is then acquired by two consumer apps on the \nAllJoyn network.   Figure: Typical Notification service framework call flow  The AllJoyn framework on the producer device does a sessionless \nsignal broadcast for the notification message. This is received \nby the AllJoyn framework on the consumer devices. The AllJoyn \nframework then fetches the notification message over unicast \nsession from the producer AllJoyn core and delivers to the \nconsumer application.",

            "text": "Notification messages  The notification message comprises a set of fields including \nmessage type and message TTL. These notification fields are \nspecified by the producer app when sending notification message \nas part of Notification service framework Producer API.  Message type and TTL fields  The message type defines the type of notification messages \n(emergency, warning and information). Multiple types of \nnotification messages can be sent at the same time by a producer. \nThe message TTL defines the validity period of the notification message.\nNotification messages can be received by consumers that connect \nduring the defined message TTL value.  Messages with the same message type will overwrite each other \non the producer, so a consumer that connects to the network \nafter the notification was sent will receive only the last \nof each message type.  Notification message behavior  The following behavior is supported using the Notification \nservice framework.   If another notification message of the same message type \nis sent by a producer app within the TTL period, the new message \noverwrites the existing message.  If a consumer connects to the network after the TTL period \nexpires, that consumer will not receive the message. For example, \nwhen a consumer such as a mobile phone is on the home network \nand the end user leaves the home; the consumer is no longer on \nthe home network. The mobile phone will not receive notification \nmessages when it reacquires the home network and the TTL of \nthose notifications have expired.   NOTE: The value is only used for message validity on the producer \ndevice. The TTL field is not sent as part of the notification \nmessage payload data over the end user's home network.  See  Notification Service Framework Use Cases  \nfor use case scenarios related to notification message behavior.  Dismissing a notification  The dismiss notification is an option for consumers that have \nreceived the notification to let the producer know that this \nnotification has been seen and there is no need to continue \nsending. It also lets other consumers know that the notification \ncan be removed from the user display.  When a consumer attempts to dismiss a notification, the service \nframework creates a session with the producer using the original \nsender field sent in the notification.  Using the original sender field confirms that the notification \nis received by the actual producer and not the super agent in \ncase the consumer received the notification from the super agent.  The producer will then send out a dismiss sessionless signal \nto notify the rest of the consumers in the network that this \nnotification has been dismissed.  If the producer is not reachable, the consumer will send out \nthe dismiss sessionless signal on its own.",

This interface is required by an application \nto provide the discovery mechanism for the service framework\ninterfaces that it supports, as well as providing the basic \nidentification information.\n\n\nScope\n\n\nThis document is targeted to the developers for AllJoyn applications.\n\n\nReferences\n\n\nExcept for RFCs, the following are reference documents found \non the AllSeen Alliance web site's Docs/Downloads section.\n\n\n\n\nAllJoyn\n Framework Tutorial\n\n\nIntroduction to AllJoyn\n Thin Client\n\n\nRFC 5646 (Tags for Identifying Languages)\n\n\n\n\nSpecificationion Overview\n\n\nThe About interface is to be implemented by an application \non a target device. This interface allows the app to advertise \nitself so other apps can discover it. Figure 1 illustrates \nthe relationship between a client app and a service app.\n\n\n\n\nFigure: About feature architecture within the AllJoyn framework\n\n\nDiscovery\n\n\nA client can discover the app via an announcement which is a \nsessionless signal containing the basic app information like \napp name, device name, manufacturer, and model number. The \nannouncement also contains the list of object paths and service \nframework interfaces to allow the client to determine whether \nthe app provides functionality of interest.\n\n\nIn addition to the sessionless announcement, the About interface \nalso provides the on-demand method calls to retrieve all the \navailable metadata about the app that are not published in \nthe announcement.\n\n\nDiscovery Call Flows\n\n\nTypical discovery flow\n\n\nFigure  2 illustrates a typical call flow for a client \nto discover a service app. The client merely relies on the \nsessionless announcement to decide whether to connect to the \nservice app to use its service framework offering.\n\n\n\n\nFigure: Typical discovery flow (client discovers a service app)\n\n\nNontypical discovery flow\n\n\nFigure 3 illustrates a call flow for a client to \ndiscover a service app and make a request for more detailed information.\n\n\n\n\nFigure: Nontypical discovery call flow\n\n\nError Handling\n\n\nThe method calls in the About interface will use the AllJoyn \nerror message handling feature (ER_BUS_REPLY_IS_ERROR_MESSAGE) \nto set the error name and error message.\n\n\nTable 1 lists the possible errors raised by the About interface.\n\n\nTable 1: About interface error handling\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nError name\n\n\nError message\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\norg.alljoyn.Error.LanguageNotSupported\n\n\nThe language specified is not supported\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAbout Interface\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nInterface name\n\n\nVersion\n\n\nSecured\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\norg.alljoyn.About\n\n\n1\n\n\nno\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nProperties\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nProperty name\n\n\nSignature\n\n\nList of values\n\n\nWritable\n\n\nDescription\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nVersion\n\n\nq\n\n\nPositive integers\n\n\nno\n\n\nInterface version number\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nMethods\n\n\nThe following methods are exposed by a BusObject that implements \nthe org.alljoyn.About interface.\n\n\nGetAboutData\n\n\nInputs\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nParameter name\n\n\nMandatory\n\n\nSignature\n\n\nList of values\n\n\nDescription\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nlanguageTag\n\n\nyes\n\n\ns\n\n\nIETF language tags specified by RFC 5646.\n\n\nThe desired language.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nOutput\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nReturn signature\n\n\nMandatory\n\n\nDescription\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\na{sv}\n\n\nyes\n\n\nA dictionary of the available metadata fields.

            "text": "Routing Node Configuration File\n\n\nThe routing node (RN) configuration file is an XML file that controls the\nbehavior of the RN and sets certain variables, such as timers, connection\nlimits, and use case characteristics.\n\n\nAn example config file may be found in the AllJoyn source distribution in\n\n../alljoyn_core/router/test/conf/sample.conf\n\n\nNote that this sample configuration file would not be useful in practice.  It is\nmerely intended to provide an example of how various elements and attributes\nare formatted.\n\n\nXML Schema\n\n\nAn XML schema, which may be used to validate config files, may be found on the\nAllSeen Alliance website:\n\n\nhttps://allseenalliance.org/schemas/busconfig.xsd\n\n\nThe schema is also available in the source code distribution at:\n\n../alljoyn_core/docs/busconfig.xsd\n\n\nThe schema may be referenced in config files by including the following\nattributes in the \nbusconfig\n (i.e., root) element:\n\n\nbusconfig\n  xmlns:xsi=\nhttp://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema-instance\n\n  xsi:noNamespaceSchemaLocation=\nhttps://allseenalliance.org/schemas/busconfig.xsd\n\n\n\n\n\nDefault Configuration\n\n\nBundled Routing Node\n\n\nThe bundled routing node consists of a routing node and a Standard Client\napplication that run in a single process.\n\n\nAs of v15.09, a user may compile AllJoyn with the scons variable \nTEST_CONFIG\n\nset to an absolute or relative path to a config file.  However, as suggested by\nthe scons variable name, this method is intended for debug and test purposes.\n\n\nIf the user does not provide a config file, then the bundled RN relies on a\nhardcoded configuration contained in the file \nBundledRouter.cc\n.\n\n\nNote that all config settings that apply to the standalone RN also apply to the\nbundled RN.\n\n\nBundled RN hardcoded configuration:\n\n ```xml\n\n\n    \nalljoyn_bundled\n\n    \ntcp:iface=\n,port=0\n\n    \nudp:iface=\n,port=0\n\n    \n20000\n\n    \n4\n\n    \n16\n\n    \n8\n\n    \n8\n\n    \nBattery powered and chargeable\n\n    \nIntermediate mobility\n\n    \n3-6 hr\n\n    \nWireless\n\n\n\n\n### Standalone Routing Node\nThe standalone RN runs as a compiled application named `alljoyn-daemon` on Linux.\nIf the user does not specify a separate configuration file when alljoyn-daemon\nis started, or the `--internal` switch is used, then the RN will use a\nconfiguration that is hardcoded in the source.\n\nNote that the standalone RN is also available as a service on Windows 10.  The\nWindows 10 service uses a hard-coded configuration and does not accept any\nparameters or switches.  The examples in this document that describe passing\nparameters or options to `alljoyn-daemon` are referring to the Linux\nimplementation.\n\n**Example (Linux):** start routing node using internal config\n\n    ./alljoyn-daemon\n\n        --OR--\n\n    ./alljoyn-daemon --internal\n\n**Standalone RN hardcoded configuration (Linux):**\n```xml\n\nbusconfig\n\n    \ntype\nalljoyn\n/type\n\n    \nlisten\nunix:abstract=alljoyn\n/listen\n\n    \nlisten\ntcp:iface=*,port=9955\n/listen\n\n    \nlisten\nudp:iface=*,port=9955\n/listen\n\n    \nlimit name=\nauth_timeout\n20000\n/limit\n\n    \nlimit name=\nmax_incomplete_connections\n16\n/limit\n\n    \nlimit name=\nmax_completed_connections\n32\n/limit\n\n    \nlimit name=\nmax_remote_clients_tcp\n0\n/limit\n\n    \nlimit name=\nmax_remote_clients_udp\n0\n/limit\n\n\n/busconfig\n\n\n\n\n\n\nUsing an External Config File\n\n\nAs previously mentioned, a user-defined, external configuration file may be\npassed to a standalone RN.  In order to start the standalone RN with an\nexternal configuration file, enter the following command (Linux):\n\n\n./alljoyn-daemon --config-file=./my_rn_config.xml\n\n\n\n\nMinimal Config File\n\n\nA minimal config file requires the root element (\nbusconfig\n) and a single\n\nlisten\n element.\n\n\nFor example:\n\n\nbusconfig\n\n    \nlisten\ntcp:iface=*,port=9955\n/listen\n\n\n/busconfig\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThis will result in a valid config file, but with very rudimentary\nfunctionality.  In fact, this configuration file would prevent the connection\nof any leaf nodes, since it does not override the default values of 0 for\n\nmax_remote_clients_tcp\n and \nmax_remote_clients_udp\n (i.e., \nlimit\n attributes).\nTherefore, it would only be able to connect to other routing nodes.\n\n\nReview of Config File Elements and Attributes\n\n\nThe default configuration settings should be suitable for most use cases.\nHowever, some applications may benefit from using different settings.  Therefore,\nthe information below is intended to provide some guidance in using\nthese settings.\n\n\nThe following is an alphabetical list of top-level XML\nelements (i.e., immediate child elements of the root element \nbusconfig\n)\navailable for use in the config file, along with a description of their meaning\nand application.  Any child elements will be described below their parent\nelement.  Likewise for attributes.\n\n\nauth\n\n\nNot used by AllJoyn.  Included for backward compatibility.  Including this\nelement in the config file will have no effect.\n\n\nflag\n\n\nNote:\n\nThe content of the flag element may be either 'true' or 'false'.  All flags\ndefault to 'false'\n\n\nname attribute (required)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nname\n\n\ndescription\n\n\ndefault\n\n\nNotes\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nns_enable_v1\n\n\nenable legacy name service if true\n\n\ntrue\n\n\nUsed for debugging.

This GUID is persisted in the keystore and provides a long-term identity for the keystore. Typically, this GUID is associated with a single application. In the scenario where a group of related applications share a given keystore, they also share the same authentication GUID.\nThis GUID is used as a mapping key for storing and accessing authentication and encryption keys.

An application instance can have at least one keystore.  A keystore is associated with a bus attachment.  If an application uses multiple bus attachments, it can have more than one keystore.\nMultiple applications running as the same user can choose to share the same keystore, but if they do, they are treated as the same security principal.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nOOB\n\n\nOut Of Band\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPeer\n\n\nA remote application participating in the AllJoyn messaging.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPermission module\n\n\nThe AllJoyn Core module that handles all the permission authorization.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nProducer\n\n\nAn AllJoyn application providing services on the AllJoyn network.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSecurity Group\n\n\nA logical grouping of devices, applications, and users. It is identified by a group ID which is a GUID and the security group authority public key. An application can be installed with a policy to expose services to members of the security group. An application or user holding a membership certificate is in fact a member of the security group. Any member of the security group can access the services exposed to the group by the applications with ACLs defined for that group.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSecurity Group Authority\n\n\nA security group authority is the user or application that defines the security group and grant membership certificates to other. The security group authority is the certificate authority for that group.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSecurity Manager\n\n\nA service used to manage cryptographic keys, and generate and distribute certificates.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSHA-256\n\n\nSecure Hash Algorithm SHA-2 with digest size of 256 bits or 32 bytes.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nUser\n\n\nThe person or business entity interacting with AllJoyn applications.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSystem Design\n\n\nOverview\n\n\nThe goal of the Security 2.0 feature is to allow an application to validate\naccess to interfaces or objects based on policies installed by the owner.  This\nfeature is part of the AllJoyn Core library.  It is not an option for the\napplication to enforce permission.  It is up to the user to dictate how the\napplication performs based on the access control lists (ACLs) defined for the\napplication.  The AllJoyn Core Permission component does all the enforcement\nincluding the concept of mutual or one-way authorization before any message\naction can be taken.\n\n\nThe Security Manager is a service that helps the user with key management and\npermission rules building.  Using the application manifest template defined by\nthe application developer, the Security Manager builds the manifest consisting\nof access control lists to let the end-user authorize which interactions the\napplication can do.  An application developer does not have to build a security\nmanager.  The permission can be installed by another application or another\nsecurity manager.\n\n\nIn addition to the encrypted messaging (using AES CCM) between the peers, the\nSecurity 2.0 Permission module manages a database of access credentials and the\nAccess Control Lists (ACLs).\n\n\nFigure shows the system architecture of the Security 2.0 feature.\n\n\n\nFigure:\n Security system diagram\n\n\nPremises\n\n\nThe following Table lists the premises for the Security 2.0 features.\n\nTable:\n Security 2.0 premises\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTopic\n\n\nDefinition\n\n\nPremises\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nIdentity\n\n\nThe application security principal\n\n\nEach peer is identified by an authentication GUID  and a cryptographic public key\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAdmin\n\n\nAn admin (or administrator) is a security principal with administrator privilege for the application\n\n\nAn admin is a member of the admin security group which has full access to any object and interface in the application\n\n\n\n\n\n\nClaim\n\n\nIncorporate a factory-reset application with the Permission Module\n\n\nA factory-reset application has no list of certificate authorities for AllJoyn security.\nA factory-reset application has no admin for AllJoyn security.\nAnyone can claim a factory-reset application.\nThe Claimer installs a FROM_CERTIFICATE_AUTHORITY ACL for an identity certificate authority\nThe Claimer installs an admin security group\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPolicy\n\n\nA policy is a list of ACLs governing  the behavior of an application\nA policy template is a list of rules defined by the application developer to guide the admin for policy building.\n\n\nAn admin can install, update, or remove a policy.\nA newer policy can be installed by any authorized peer. Developers can define policy templates to help the admin with policy building.\nSecurity group specific policy specifies the permissions granted to members of the group. The security group authority becomes a certificate authority for that particular group.\nA policy may exist at the producer or consumer side. Policy enforcement applies wherever it resides.\nA policy is considered private.  It is not exchanged with any peer.\nA keystore has at most one policy.  A complex application with multiple bus attachments can use a shared keystore in one bus attachment and an app-specific keystore for another bus attachment.  In such case, the complex application has in fact more than one policy.\nAn admin can query the existing policy installed in the keystore.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nMembership certificate\n\n\nA membership certificate is the proof of a security group membership\n\n\nMembership certificates are exchanged between peers.\nAn application trusts a membership certificate if the issuer or any subject in the issuer\u2019s certificate chain is the security group authority.\nA membership certificate subject can generate additional membership certificates for the given security group if the cA flag is true.\nA membership certificate must have a security group ID.\nAn application can accept the installation of any number of membership certificates into its keystore.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nIdentity certificate\n\n\nCertificate that signs the identity information.\n\n\nThe Certificate has an identity alias stored in the X.509 SubjectAltName extension field.\nAn application trusts identity certificates issued by the application\u2019s certificate authority or any of the security group authorities listed in the application\u2019s policy.\nAn identity certificate subject can generate additional identity if the cA flag is true.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nManifest data\n\n\nThe permission rules accompanying the identity certificate\n\n\nManifest data are not present in the identity certificate. They are accompanied with the identity certificate.\nThe manifest data digest is present in the identity certificate.\nThe manifest data syntax is the same as the policy syntax.  While the policy stays local the manifest data is presented to the peer along with the identity certificate.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSecurity Manager\n\n\nA service used to manage cryptographic keys, and generate certificates.\n\n\nSecurity Manager can push policy and certificates to application\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTypical operations\n\n\nThe following subsections describe the typical operations performed by a user.\n\n\nAssumptions\n\n\nIn all the flows listed in this section, the Security Manager is assumed to be\nclaimed by another Security Manager or to be self-claimed.  The certificates may\nhave been issued from sources in the cloud.  As the result, the Security Manager\nis shown with one certificate authority and an identity certificate.\n\n\nSample Certificates and Policy Entries\n\n\nThe following is a high level presentation of certificates and policy entries\nused in the flows in this section.\n\n\n\n\nFigure:\n Sample Certificates and ACL entries\n\n\nThe peer types\n\n\nThe following peer types are supported in the permission policy.  A peer may match many of the peer types.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPeer Type\n\n\nDescription\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nALL\n\n\nThis matches all peers including an anonymous peer using ECDHE_NULL key exchange.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nANY_TRUSTED\n\n\nThis matches any authenticated peer for all authentication methods except ECDHE_NULL key exchange.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFROM_CERTIFICATE_AUTHORITY\n\n\nThis matches any peer authenticated via ECDHE_ECDSA key exchange and its identity certificate\u2019s trust is verified against the specific certificate authority listed in the policy for this type of peer.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nWITH_PUBLIC_KEY\n\n\nThis matches a peer with the specific public key.  The peer is authenticated via ECDHE_ECDSA key exchange.  Its identity certificate\u2019s trust is verified against any of the application\u2019s certificate authorities (including the security group authorities).\n\n\n\n\n\n\nWITH_MEMBERSHIP\n\n\nThis matches any peer with possession of a membership certificate with the specific security group ID.\nThe peer is authenticated via ECDHE_ECDSA key exchange.  Its identity certificate\u2019s trust is verified against any of the application\u2019s certificate authority (including the security group authorities).\nThe subject of the membership certificate must be the peer\u2019s public key.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nDefine a security group\n\n\nAny user can define a security group (logical grouping of applications and\nusers) using a Security Manager. When the user specifies a security group name\n(for display purpose), the Security Manager creates the security group ID\n(a GUID value).\n\n\nRequired Key Exchanges\n\n\nThe framework requires either ECHDE_NULL or ECDHE_PSK key exchange for the claim\nprocess.  Once the application is claimed, only the ECDHE_ECDSA key exchange is\nallowed unless the policy allows for anonymous user; in such case, ECDHE_NULL is\nacceptable.\n\n\nCertificate exchange during session establishment\n\n\nDuring the AllJoyn ECHDE_ECDSA key exchange and session establishment, the peers\nexchange identity certificates, manifests, and all membership certificates.\nSince all the membership certificates are exchanged, there is a potential\ninformation disclosure vulnerability.  It is desired to have a more intelligent\nselection algorithm to provide membership certificates on demand and need-to-know\nbasis.  This algorithm needs to take into account the latency of the certificate\nexchange during the method call invocation.\n\n\nThe bus attachment trusts the peer if the issuer of the peer\u2019s identity\ncertificate is any of its certificate authorities and any of the security group\nauthorities listed in the application\u2019s policy.\n\n\nAfter the session key is generated, the peers exchange all the membership\ncertificates.  Each membership certificate\u2019s trust is checked against the\npublic key of the authority of the security group.\n\n\n\n\nFigure:\n Exchange manifest and membership certificates\n\n\nThe identity certificate chain is exchanged during the ECDHE_ECDSA key exchange\nprocess.  The org.alljoyn.Bus.Peer.Authentication interface is not enforced with\npermission.\n\n\nClaim a factory-reset application\n\n\nUsing a Security Manager any user can claim any factory-reset application. The\nfactory-reset application is assumed to be already onboarded to the network.  It\nis recommended the claiming process occurs during the onboarding process while\nthe peers are connected via the SoftAP.\n\n\n\n\nFigure:\n Recommend to claim during onboarding\n\n\nClaiming is a first-come, first-claim action. The user installs an admin\nsecurity group.  The procedure to make the application to become claimable again\nis manufacturer-specific.   See the FactoryReset() in the Configuration\ninterface.  There will be an API call that allows the application to make itself\nclaimable again.\n\n\nClaim factory-reset application without out-of-band registration data\n\n\n\n\nFigure:\n Claim a factory-reset application without using out-of-band\nregistration data\n\n\nThe identity certificate will be used for authentication in the ECDHE_ECDSA key\nexchange.\n\n\nClaim factory-reset application using out-of-band registration data\n\n\nAn application manufacturer can provision a key or the application can\ndynamically generate a key to support the claiming process. The ECDHE_PSK key\nexchange is used in this scenario. The key is provided to the user out of band.\nAn example is a QR code or a token delivered via email or text messaging. The\nuser is prompted for the key when establishing a connection with the\nfactory-reset application.\n\n\n\n\nFigure:\n Claiming a factory-reset application using out-of-band registration\ndata\n\n\nExample of building a policy\n\n\nA user uses a Security Manager application to build a policy. The Security\nManager application queries the About data and manifest templates from the\napplication. The Security Manager application can do further introspection of\nthe application for the detailed information of securable interfaces and secured\nobjects, and prompt the user to select the permissions to include in the policy.\n\n\nA policy may contain a number of ACLs.  Please refer to section\n\n(Policy ACL format)\n for more information.\n\n\nInstall a policy\n\n\nAn admin can install a policy for the application.\n\n\nWhen a policy is installed, the core framework may expire master secrets\nincluding existing session keys if it is not able to apply the new policy without\nre-authenticating the peer.  Resource constrained devices are most likely to\nexpire master secrets.  Expiring keys will cause existing sessions to terminate.\n\n\n\n\nFigure:\n Install a policy\n\n\nUpdate a manifest\n\n\nAn admin can update a manifest for the application.  This involves resigning the\nidentity certificate because the new digest of the manifest must be included in\nthe identity certificate.\n\n\n\n\nFigure:\n Update manifest\n\n\nAdd an application to a security group\n\n\nAn admin issues a membership certificate with the given security group ID and\nprovides it to the application to install in its keystore. This act adds the\napplication to the security group.\n\n\n\n\nFigure:\n Add an application to a security group\n\n\nAdd a user to a security group\n\n\nThe security group authority uses the Security Manager to generate the membership\ncertificate for another user for the given security group ID.\n\n\nIn the following flow, the security group authority named \u201cuser\u201d provides a\nmembership certificate for security group LivingRoomGUID to the other user named\n\u201cuser2.\u201d\n\n\n\n\nFigure:\n Add a user to a security group\n\n\nSecurity Manager\n\n\nIntroduction\n\n\nThe AllJoyn security 2.0 ecosystem consists of many applications and devices.\nThose applications and devices are deployed in various setups and for them it is\nimpossible to know up front what other peers they will see around them let alone\nknow how they should interact with them. Which peers can be trusted, which\nrights do those peers have\u2026 So after being deployed, applications and devices\nhave to be configured. The people in charge of configuring the system, the\nadministrators need a service for this. Such a service is called a security\nmanager.\n\n\nDepending on your setup, you need a different service. A large enterprise has\ndifferent requirements than a home does. Not all administrators have a strong\ntechnical background. A tool for home users should have a straightforward,\nunderstandable user interface (hiding the more complex features). These\nsimplifications should be done inside the security manager, so it is transparent\nfor applications and devices in which setup they are deployed. Application\ndevelopers should make no distinction between enterprise and small home.\n\n\nA security configuration consists of two parts:\n1. Certificates: certificates provide proof that an application is managed by a\n   security manager. They can be used to gain access to resources of other peers\n   or to provide resources themselves to others. The certificates describe the\n   rights the subject has.\n2. Policy: A policy is a list of Access Control Lists (ACLs). These ACLs\n   describe how other peers can access the holder of the policy.\n\n\nSecurity managers use AllJoyn to transfer this configuration to applications and\ndevices they manage.\n\n\nSecurity Manager Architecture\n\n\nA security manager is a service that can take multiple forms. For a home setup\nit can be a single application accessed by one person. For an enterprise setup,\nmultiple administrators need to use it, so its core can run on a server, with\nsome local application talking to it. When discussing the functional blocks of\nthe security manager, it is important to understand that those blocks can reside\non different machines and that for some of these we even have multiple instances.\n\n\n\n\nThe manager provides certificates. In order to generate and sign certificates,\n  it needs to have a certificate authority (CA).\n\n\nConfiguration storage: The security manager should keep track of what the\n  configuration looks like. To do so, it should persist the configuration data.\n\n\nUI: The administrator needs to interact with the security manager in order to\n  make configuration changes. The user interface doesn't need to be part of the\n  manager itself. It could be running in a web browser or it could offer a REST\n  API, so that custom UI can be built on top.\n\n\nAllJoyn Agent (security manager agent): Configuration updates are sent using\n  AllJoyn as the communication protocol. The agent is the component which does\n  the interaction with the managed peers.\n\n\n\n\nThe following assumptions are made:\n\n The four functional blocks of the security manager can be combined into a\n  single application, but it should be possible to run them in different\n  applications or even on different hosts.\n\n A security manager can have multiple security manager agents acting on its\n  behalf.\n\n The security manager topology is transparent for AllJoyn applications.\n\n A security manager is identified by the public key of its CA. We call this the\n  key of the security manager.\n\n\nThe Alliance envisions multiple implementations of security managers and does\nnot provide implementation specifications. The Alliance does specify a set of\ninterfaces that allow the security managers to interact with AllJoyn security 2.0\nbased applications and devices.\n\n\nWhat the Security Manager manages\n\n\nWe already mentioned a number of times that a security manager manages\napplications and devices. But what does it mean and do we really manage\napplications and devices? The security manager agent will use AllJoyn security\nfeatures to set up a secure connection to a peer. The only way it has to\nsecurely identify this peer is by looking at that peer's public key. Since we\nhand out certificates granting rights to this key, in fact it means we are\nmanaging keys. So when asking what are we managing, we should ask ourselves who\nhas access to a key? There is no easy answer to this questions. It all depends\non the OS and platform the software is running on.\n\n\n\n\nOn a plain Linux or Windows machine, applications can choose to protect data\n  on a per-user basis, making it hard to protect the key from other applications\n  running as the same user. On the other hand, the key is also not\n  application-specific. When the same application runs as a different user, it\n  can't access the key anymore.\n\n\nOperating systems on smartphone do a better job at sandboxing applications.\n  The link between key and application is stronger there.\n\n\n\n\nHow many keys you need per device depends on the device:\n\n A single-function device (e.g., a temperature sensor) is considered as one big\n  application. One key to do all operations.\n\n Every app on a smartphone is considered as an app on its own, so one key per\n  application.\n* The built-in firmware of a smart TV is also considered as a single app.\n  Applications installed on top of the firmware of the TV are separate apps and\n  should have their own key.\n\n\nWhat we can trust\n\n\nThe AllSeen Alliance offers a software stack that runs on top of some hardware\nwithin an OS. The stack can be embedded in an application which is installed on\na device or could be integrated in a firmware of a device. The security manager\ncannot distinguish this. He only sees a remote peer. Furthermore the security\nmanager cannot assume applications are running on trustworthy systems. If an\napplication runs on a compromised or malicious system, there is little we can do\ninside the app to protect.  A genuine application running on malicious system,\nshould be treated as malicious. We should protect the ecosystem by:\n\n\n\n\nBeing able to revoke the rights granted to an application.\n\n\nMake sure compromised or even malicious applications are limited to rights\n   they were given. Since we can't trust the OS or hardware the application is\n   running on, these checks must be done at the remote peer side.\n\n\n\n\nThe protective measure should be defined so that a well-behaving app on a well\nbehaving system can protect itself from any unwarranted access. If both peers\nare malicious, then there is little we can do. But then they don't need AllSeen\nto perform malicious acts. There is a risk though that 2 malicious applications\nteam up. Each individual app gets a small acceptable set of rights, but then\ncombining their rights to launch an attack.\n\n\nWhen claiming an application two considerations must be made:\n\n\n\n\nCan I trust the application?\n\n\nCan I trust the device where the application is running on? But not only the\n   device and its OS, but for desktops systems as well which other applications\n   are there? These apps might to try get access to the keystore of the genuine\n   app. This is not something we can fix within the AllSeen Alliance. This\n   remains an integration aspect\n\n\n\n\nSharing Keystores\n\n\nWhen an application is claimed, it will store its certificates inside a keystore.\nThis keystore can be shared. The security manager nor the system can prevent\napplications from doing this. Is it recommended to share keystores? It has the\nadvantage that you only have to claim one application, while multiple\napplications can use it. However the certificates in the store will only grant a\nlimited set of permission to its users. Sharing the store only makes sense if it\nwas granted all permissions required by its applications. Sharing keystore can\nbe allowed if the applications granted access to it are known upfront and the\nunion of rights is known.\n\n\nSharing keystores does have some side effects.  Every app using the keystore\nwill appear as the same manageable application. The security will be able to\nmanage one keystore via multiple apps. This feature requires additional layer of\ncomplexity in order to provide the concurrent access to the shared keystore.\n\n\nWe also partially lose the ability to sandbox applications, as applications\nusing a shared keystore get a full set of rights linked to the store and not\nnecessarily the ones they strictly need.\n\n\nApplications integrated in firmware\n\n\nThe firmware of a device could consist of multiple smaller AllSeen applications.\nFrom end-user perspective you only want to claim this device once. Those\napplications are allowed to share their keystore, but only one of them should\nprovide the Security interfaces. So only one application is seen from security\nmanager perspective. When expressing the permission required for this\napplication, it should request all permissions required by the apps on that\ndevice.\n\n\nStandalone applications\n\n\nStandalone applications are apps downloaded and installed on a desktop computer,\ntablet or smart phone or something similar. Standalone applications should not\nshare their  keystore with other applications. If such an application is built\nout of separate sub-applications (each of them uses a separate bus attachment),\nthen they should follow the same rules as applications integrated in firmware.\n\n\nSecurity Manager Operations\n\n\nThe security manager allows the following operations:\n- security group management: create, update and delete security groups\n    - allow grouping of applications. A group is uniquely defined by GUID and\n      the public key of a security manager. Applications can become members of a\n      group when they are issued a membership certificate for that group\n- identity management: create, update and delete identities\n    - Identities are used to define the users of application. Users can map to\n      physical persons.  Applications can act on behalf of a user when they\n      receive an identity certificate for that user\u2019s security manager.  An\n      application keystore should only have one identity certificate.\n- application/key management:\n    - claim applications: make it managed by this security manager\n    - manage application manifest\n    - manage AllJoyn certificates for these applications\n    - manage policy (ACL's) of applications\n    - force application to become un-managed again\n\n\nInter Security Manager Interaction\n\n\nWhen applications interact with each other, they check if the interaction is\nallowed by their policies as previously set by their security manager. In\npractice, a peer must present a certificate (chain) signed by its security\nmanager public key. Meaning that with the basic features we created silos, you\ncan only talk to applications managed by your own security manager. In practice\napplications managed by different security managers need to interact with each\nother as well. We provide 2 ways to do this: Delegation and Restricted User.\n\n\nDelegation\n\n\nUse case\n\n\nI\u2019m the administrator of my home ecosystem. I claim appliances in the home and\nprovide them with configuration. I as administrator am the only person having\naccess to the security manager. When my kids want to get access to an appliance,\nthen they have to ask me to get approval for each application they want to use.\nThis may not be sufficient for all use cases. With delegation, my security\nmanager gives a membership certificate with delegation rights to the security\nmanager of each of my kids. With this certificate, they can delegate these\nrights to their applications. They only need to ask one time and then they can\nmake any of their applications part of my group. Even though my kids did not\ninteract directly with each other, with these delegated certificates they\ninteract with each other in the scope of this group.\n\n\nLimitations\n\n\nThe followings are the limitations of using delegation.\n- You can only authenticate members of the group. Mutual authenticated requests\n  can only be done between members of the group.\n- My kids get Remote-control rights for the TV by giving them a membership\n  certificate with delegation rights for my TV Group. Their remote control\n  applications become members of the TV group. If I give my TV a policy for the\n  TV group, then the TV will allow the request from the remote control apps of\n  my kids. This requires my kids to define an ANY-TRUSTED policy for TV\n  operations for their apps. This is ok for TVs remote control operations. If\n  mutual authentication is required, the TV must become member of the TV group\n  as well.\n- For a chat use case you need to know who is sending a message and to whom\n  you\u2019re sending messages. So mutual authentication is required, and all\n  participants have to be in that group.\n- As policy is defined on group level, it would require separate groups in order\n  to differentiate between kids and parents.\n\n\nDelegating certificate Flow\n\n\nIn the X.509 membership and identity certificates, the delegate concept is\nrepresented by the basicConstraints extension cA flag.  If a grantee receives a\ncertificate with the X.509 basicConstraints extension cA flag equal to true, the\ngrantee can issue a certificate to others.  If the cA flag is false then a peer validating a\ncertificate chain verifies that no further delegation has been done, or the\nchain is considered invalid.\n\n\n\n\nFigure:\n Reissue membership certificate\n\n\nRestricted access for other security manager\n\n\nRestricted access tries to address the same problem as delegation but takes a\ndifferent approach to solve it. With delegation, you give a certificate to an\napplication. With that certificate the application can prove it is allowed\naccess to a group. With restricted access we define a policy on our managed\napplications that allows applications from a different security manager to get\naccess. This would be as if we would pre-install the delegated membership\ncertificate on all our managed applications. So when the peer comes around, he\ndoesn't need to send the proof, the application already has it. Since policy\ncomes from a trusted source, we don't need to distribute certificates, we can\ndefine a more compact ACL.\n\n\nIn practice, the security manager defines a restricted peer type for all\napplications that need to interact with the applications of the peer security\nmanager. This ACL restricts applications of that security manager to a specific\nset of rules. Those applications just need to prove that they are owned with an\nidentity certificate verifiable with the peer security manager certificate\nauthority. That authority is installed with the restricted peer entry into the\nlocal application policy.\n\n\nAs example use case: Suppose we have a real-estate agent. When showing a house\nto clients, he'd like to show-off the AllSeen-enabled home automation system.\nThis can be achieved with either delegation or restricted user. The advantage of\nrestricted user is that if he potentially needs to show 100 homes, he can do it\nbased on 1 certificate instead of 100 for the delegation scenario. There is less\nrisk for information disclosure. If someone could get hold of the 100\ncertificates, then he can learn who the home sellers are. In the restricted user\ncase, the seller's public keys are in the policy of the agent's app and policy\nis never shared.\n\n\nInstall a restricted peer ACL Flow\n\n\nThe admin installs a FROM_CERTIFICATE_AUTHORITY ACL into his local application\u2019s\npolicy to allow his friend to have access to the local application.\n\n\n\n\nFigure:\n Add restricted user rules to an application\n\n\nApplication Manifest\n\n\nWhen considering where AllSeen enabled applications will run, smartphones are an\nobvious target. A lot of applications are available in various app stores.\nUnfortunately not all of these applications are trustworthy. For example, the\nflashlight app asks for access to phonebook, network, etc. Same as the\napplication is sandboxed on the smartphone, we would like to sandbox\napplications within the AllSeen security 2.0 context. If I install an AllSeen TV\nremote control app, then I would like it only to have rights to do TV\noperations. Nothing more. Since we can't trust the application, we can't assume\nit will behave properly. So these restrictions must be enforced by the peers.\nFor the remote control example, the TV must check whether the app has\npermissions. When remote control app tries to open the door, then the door must\nreject the call.\n\n\nThe main goal of an application manifest is to inform an admin which interfaces\nan application will produce and consume. Once the admin accepts the manifest,\nthe manifest is signed and installed on the application. The signed manifest\nwill be used to enforce that the application cannot produce or consume any\nunwarranted interfaces.\n\n\nA signed application manifest limits the potential interfaces a malicious\napplication can access within a set of well-behaving applications.\n\n\nThe application manifest has a similar goal as an application manifest on an app\nstore application, in which an end-user has to accept a list of permissions when\ninstalling a new application on his phone which are enforced by the app store\napplication framework. The implementation is however different, as described\nbelow.\n\n\nRequirements\n\n\nManifest Format\n\n\nThe manifest must be expressed at the interface level. It may be expressed at\nthe member level, but this is not recommended as this increases the complexity\nthat needs to be handled by the admin.\n\n\nManifest Acceptance\n\n\nThe manifest template must be presented to the admin in a user-friendly way. As\nthe interface names might not be very informative, they must be mapped to a\nuser-friendly description.\n\n\nAs a malicious application can by definition not be trusted, the descriptions\nmust be provided by a trustworthy source.\n\n\nThe descriptions of the interfaces should be localized to the admin.\n\n\nThe AllSeen Alliance must provide descriptions for any standard AllSeen\ninterface, as reviewed and recommended by the Interface Review Board (IRB).\n\n\nThe application developer must provide the descriptions of any application\nspecific interfaces.\n\n\nIf a manifest template is defined at the member level, a description for each\nlisted member must be available.\n\n\nManifest Enforcement\n\n\nThe accepted manifest must be enforced by the peer application, as a malicious\napplication may not be trusted to enforce it locally.\n\n\nManifest Update\n\n\nWhenever an application is updated and does not require additional rights, it\nmay still use the previously signed manifest. Only when the update requires\nadditional rights, the application changes its state and signal the change to\nlet the admin know about the existence of a new manifest template.  The admin\ncan generate a new manifest for that application.\n\n\nImplementation Scenario\n\n\nThis section describes the steps to generate the application manifest.  Once the\nmanifest is accepted,  its contents digest will be encoded in a new identity\ncertificate.\n\n\n\n\nThe security manager discovers the remote application through the\n   NotifyConfig signal.\n\n\nThe security manager retrieves the manifest template of the application.\n\n\nUsing the manifest template, the security manager starts the manifest\n   building process.\n\n\nThe security manager contacts a server via HTTPS to retrieve the human\n   readable description of the interfaces and presents them to the admin.  Note\n   that the HTTPS server location is not yet defined.\n\n\nThe admin accepts (or rejects) the description of the manifest. When the\n   admin rejects the manifest, the application will not receive a manifest.\n\n\nThe security manager reissues a new identity certificate with the digest of\n   the requested (\n accepted) permissions.\n\n\nThe security manager installs the new identity certificate and manifest on\n   the application.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure:\n Building Policy using manifest\n\n\nApplication\n\n\nThe application developer needs to embed the manifest template in his\napplication. There should be a platform specific callback function to retrieve\nthe manifest template that belongs to an application. For app store\napplications, it could be based on convention, providing the manifest template\nas a file inside the application package. For small embedded devices, the\nmanifest template could be part of the application.\n\n\nTo ease the generation of membership certificates by the security manager, the\nmanifest format is the same format that is used to express access rules in the\nmembership certificates.\n\n\nInterface Description Server\n\n\nThe server serving the descriptions of the interfaces can either be:\n1. Hosted by the application developer for application specific interfaces. To\n   prevent spoofing attacks, this server must be contacted via HTTPS and its URL\n   must be based on the reverse domain name of the interface name.\n2. Hosted by the AllSeen Alliance for common AllSeen interfaces. This server\n   MUST be contacted over HTTPS.  Howeer, the URL for this server is not yet\n   defined.\n\n\nManifest Enforcement\n\n\nWhen applying the specific policy rules, the remote peer will enforce the rules\nspecified in the manifest since the manifest is associated with the identity\ncertificate.\n\n\nAccess validation\n\n\nValidating policy on a producer\n\n\nThis is a typical producer validation of a consumer\u2019s permissions when the\nconsumer makes a method call on a secure interface.\n\n\n\n\nFigure:\n Validating policy on a producer\n\n\nValidating policy on a consumer\n\n\nThis is a typical consumer policy validation when the consumer application calls\na secure method call.\n\n\n\n\nFigure:\n Validating policy for a consumer\n\n\nValidating policy on a consumer that requires a producer belong to a security group\n\n\nThe following flow shows a policy enforcement on the consumer that requires the\nproducer belong to a security group.\n\n\n\n\nFigure:\n Consumer policy requires producer belong to a security group\n\n\nAnonymous session\n\n\nIn scenarios when there is no trust established between two peers such as when a\nguest comes into the user's home, the guest\u2019s consumer application can still\ncontrol certain applications if and only if there are ACLs specified for ALL\ninstalled on these devices.\n\n\nNote that ANY_TRUSTED includes only authenticated peers while ALL includes\nunauthenticated (anonymous) peers.\n\n\nAccessing secured interfaces, the consumer always use ECDHE_ECDSA to contact a\npeer.  If the key exchange fails, it can fallback to ECDHE_NULL and contact the\npeer as an anonymous user.  This process is automated so the application\ndeveloper does not need to drive the key exchange process.\n\n\n\n\nFigure:\n Anonymous access\n\n\nValidating an admin user\n\n\n\n\nFigure:\n Validating an admin\n\n\nEmitting a session-based signal\n\n\nBefore emitting a session-based signal to existing connections, the producer\nverifies whether it is allowed to emit the given signal to any authorized party.\nUpon receipt of the signal, the consumer checks whether it has the authorization\nto accept the given signal.  The consumer verifies the producer\u2019s manifest for\nproper authorization.\n\n\n\n\nFigure:\n Validating a session-based signal\n\n\nPolicy ACL format\n\n\nThe format is binary and exchanged between peers using AllJoyn marshalling\n\n\nThe policy data will be in binary format.

In order for a rule to be considered a match,\nit must meet the following criteria:\n- Be in an access control list matching peer type, public key,\nand/or Security Group ID as specified for the ACL\n- Match message header data based object path, interface name and member\nname as specified for the rule.\n- Match the action mask and not be an explicit deny.\n\n\nOr the rule must match the following criteria:\n- Be in the ACL of a peer type WITH_PUBLIC_KEY\n- The ACL's key must match the public key of the peer\n- The action mask must be an explicit deny.\n- All other criteris (object path, interface and member names) must be *\n\n\nThe resulting set of matched rules is applied to the message as follows:\n- If any explicit deny rule matches per above then the message is denied.\n- If no deny rules match, then the message is allowed if at least one allow\nrule matches.\n- Otherwise, the message is denied.\n\n\nCertificates\n\n\nThe following subsections detail the supported certificates.  The certificate\nformat is X.509 v3.  The certificate lifetime will be considered in order to\navoid having to revoke the certificate.  However, certain devices do not have\naccess to a trusted real time clock.  In such cases, applications on those\ndevices will not be able to validate the certificate lifetime.\n\n\nCertificate Chain validation\n\n\nIdentity and membership certificate chains will be validated per section 6.1 of\nRFC 5280 with the following additions, limitations and notes:\n- The leaf certificate must have exactly one EKU and it must be the correct EKU\nper the use case.  Certificates used for ECDHE_ECDSA authentication must\nhave the identity certificate EKU and certificates exchanged to indicate\nsecurity group memberships must have the membership certificate EKU.\n- Intermediate certificates must have zero, one or both identity and membership\nEKUs.\n- No EKU will be treated as any EKU, per RFC 5280. EKU validation is transitive,\nmeaning any certificate with no EKU will inherit those of its parent.\n- Time of validity will only be evaluated if the peer has a time source.\n- The implementation will assume system time is trusted if available.\n- For identity certificates, the associated digest of the leaf certificate\nis validated against the digest of the manifest.\n- The AKI is validated to not be null.\n- CRL check is not implemented as there is no CRL.\n- basicConstraints::pathLenConstraint will NOT be checked.\n\n\nCertificate chains will be validated...\n- When a certificate is received during claiming.\n- When a certificate is installed.\n- When a certificate is received during ECDHE_ECDSA authentication.\n- When a certificate is received to assert security group membership.\n\n\n2.6.1 Main Certificate Structure\n\n\nAll AllSeen X.509 certificates have the following ASN.1 structure.  Currently\nonly the ECDSA (prime256v1) certificates are supported.\n\n\nCertificate ::= SEQUENCE {\n    tbsCertificate TBSCertificate,\n    signatureAlgorithm SEQUENCE { 1.2.840.10045.4.3.2 (ecdsa-with-sha256) },\n    signatureValue BIT STRING\n}\n\nTBSCertificate ::= SEQUENCE {\n    version v3(2),\n    serialNumber INTEGER,\n    signature SEQUENCE { 1.2.840.10045.4.3.2 (ecdsa-with-sha256) },\n    issuer SEQUENCE { 2.5.4.3 (commonName), UTF8 STRING },\n    validity Validity,\n    subject Name,\n    subjectPublicKeyInfo SEQUENCE { 1.2.840.10045.2.1 (id-ecPublicKey), 1.2.840.10045.3.1.7 (prime256v1), BIT STRING },\n    issuerUniqueID IMPLICIT UniqueIdentifier OPTIONAL,\n    subjectUniqueID IMPLICIT UniqueIdentifier OPTIONAL,\n    extensions EXPLICIT\n}\n\nExtensions ::= SEQUENCE {\n    BasicConstraints SEQUENCE { 2.5.29.19 (basicConstraints), BOOLEAN (FALSE) },\n    SubjectAltName SEQUENCE { 2.5.29.17 (id-ce-subjectAltName),\n                    SEQUENCE { CHOICE[0] (otherName)\n                      SEQUENCE { 1.3.6.1.4.1.44924.1.3 (AllSeen Security Group ID),\n                          OCTET STRING}}},\n    ExtendedKeyUsage SEQUENCE { 2.5.29.37 (id-ce-extKeyUsage),\n                                SEQUENCE { (KeyPurposeId) OBJECT IDENTIFIER}},\n    AuthorityKeyIdentifier SEQUENCE { 2.5.29.35  (id-ce-authorityKeyIdentifier),\n                                      SEQUENCE { [0] (keyIdentifier) OCTET STRING}}\n}\n\n\n\n\n\nAuthorityKeyIdentifier\n\n\nThe AuthorityKeyIdentifier standard extension field will hold 64 bits of data\ncomprising of a four-bit type field with the value 0100 followed by the least\nsignificant 60 bits of a hash of the value of the BIT STRING\nsubjectPublicKey (excluding the tag, length, and number of unused bits).\n\n\nSecurity 2.0 Custom OIDs\n\n\nAll Security 2.0 custom OIDs will start with \n1.3.6.1.4.1.44924.1\n where\n\n1.3.6.1.4.1.44924\n is the registered AllSeen Alliance Private Enterprise\nNumber.\n\n\nIdentity certificate\n\n\nThe identity certificate is used to associate application, user or device with\nan identity alias.  This allows an identity alias to have a number of identity\ncertificates installed in different keystores.\n\n\nThe identity alias is encoded in the SubjectAltName field in the extensions.\n\n\nThe extensions include the following fields:\n - ExtendedKeyUsage: the type of certificate within the AllSeen ecosystem.\n\n 1.3.6.1.4.1.44924.1.1 is used for Identity certificates.\n - SubjectAltName: the alias for the identity.\n - AssociatedDigest: the digest of the associated manifest data.\nBoth the ExtendedKeyUsage and AssociatedDigest have custom OIDs under the\nSecurity 2.0 root.\n\n\nExtensions ::= SEQUENCE {\nBasicConstraints SEQUENCE { 2.5.29.19 (basicConstraints), BOOLEAN (FALSE) },\nSubjectAltName SEQUENCE { 2.5.29.17 (id-ce-subjectAltName),\n     SEQUENCE { CHOICE[0] (otherName)\n                SEQUENCE { 1.3.6.1.4.1.44924.1.3\n                           (AllSeen Security Group ID), OCTET STRING}}},\nAuthorityKeyIdentifier SEQUENCE { 2.5.29.35\n                                  (id-ce-authorityKeyIdentifier),\n                                   SEQUENCE { [0] (keyIdentifier) OCTET STRING}},\nExtendedKeyUsage SEQUENCE { 2.5.29.37 (id-ce-extKeyUsage),\n                            SEQUENCE { (KeyPurposeId) 1.3.6.1.4.1.44924.1.1}},\nAssociatedDigest SEQUENCE { 1.3.6.1.4.1.44924.1.2 (AllSeen Certificate Digest),\n                            2.16.840.1.101.3.4.2.1 (hash), OCTET STRING }\n}\n\n\n\n\n\nMembership certificate\n\n\nThe membership certificate is used to assert an application, user or device is\npart of a security group.\n\n\nThe security group identifier is encoded with a 16 network byte order octets\nencoded in the SubjectAltName field in the extensions.\n\n\nThe extensions include the following fields:\n- ExtendedKeyUsage: the type of certificate within the AllSeen ecosystem.\n\n1.3.6.1.4.1.44924.1.5 is used for membership certificates.\n- SubjectAltName: the security group ID.\n\n\nExtensions ::= SEQUENCE {\nBasicConstraints SEQUENCE { 2.5.29.19 (basicConstraints), BOOLEAN (FALSE) },\nSubjectAltName SEQUENCE { 2.5.29.17 (id-ce-subjectAltName),\n     SEQUENCE { CHOICE[0] (otherName)\n                SEQUENCE { 1.3.6.1.4.1.44924.1.3\n                           (AllSeen Security Group ID), OCTET STRING}}},\nAuthorityKeyIdentifier SEQUENCE { 2.5.29.35\n                                  (id-ce-authorityKeyIdentifier),\n                                   SEQUENCE { [0] (keyIdentifier) OCTET STRING}},\nExtendedKeyUsage SEQUENCE { 2.5.29.37 (id-ce-extKeyUsage),\n                            SEQUENCE { (KeyPurposeId) 1.3.6.1.4.1.44924.1.5}}\n}\n\n\n\n\nRecommended Best Practices for Certificates\n\n\n\n\nRoot certificates should include only the ExtendedKeyUsage OIDs for purposes\nfor which it will issue certificates.  Currently, these are the AllJoyn\nidentity and membership OIDs listed in this document.  Issuing root certificates\nwith no ExtendedKeyUsage extension or with the anyExtendedKeyUsage OID is\nnot recommended.  Adopting this practice will limit the potential abuse of\nAllJoyn root certificates for unrelated purposes.\n\n\n\n\nSample use cases\n\n\nThe solution listed here for the use cases is just a typical solution.  It is\nnot intended to be the only solution.\n\n\nUsers and devices\n\n\nUsers:  Dad, Mom, and son\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSecurity Group\n\n\nMembers\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nhomeAdmin\n\n\nDad, Mom\n\n\n\n\n\n\nsonAdmin\n\n\nSon\n\n\n\n\n\n\ndadOnlyAdmin\n\n\nDad\n\n\n\n\n\n\nlivingRoom\n\n\nTV, living room tablet, son\u2019s room TV, master bedroom TV, master bedroom tablet\n\n\n\n\n\n\nmasterBedrom\n\n\nMaster bedroom tablet\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nRoom\n\n\nDevices\n\n\nNotes\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nLiving room\n\n\nTV, Set-top box, tablet, Network-attached Storage (NAS)\n\n\nAll devices claimed by Dad and managed by Mon and Dad using the security group homeAdmin\nAll devices are accessible for the whole family\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSon\u2019s bedroom\n\n\nTV\n\n\nClaimed and managed by son\nTV is allowed to interact with living room devices for streaming data\n\n\n\n\n\n\nMaster bedroom\n\n\nTV, tablet\n\n\nTV used by Mom and Dad only\nTablet used by Dad only\nTV is allowed to interact with living room devices for streaming data\nTablet has full control of living room devices including the parent control feature\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nUsers set up by Dad\n\n\n\n\nFigure:\n Use case - users set up by Dad\n\n\nLiving room set up by Dad\n\n\n\n\nFigure:\n Use case - living room set up by Dad\n\n\nSon's bedroom set up by son\n\n\n\n\nFigure:\n Use case - son's bedroom set up by son\n\n\nMaster bedroom set up by Dad\n\n\n\n\nFigure:\n Use case - master bedroom set up by Dad\n\n\nSon can control different TVs in the house\n\n\n\n\nFigure:\n Use case \u2013 Son can control different TVs in the house\n\n\nLiving room tablet controls TVs in the house\n\n\n\n\nFigure:\n Use case - Living room tablet controls TVs\n\n\nEnhancements to Existing Framework\n\n\nCrypto Agility Exchange\n\n\nIn order to provide the AllJoyn peers to express the desire to pick some\nparticular cryptographic cipher suite to use in the key exchange and the\nencryption of the messages, new key exchange suite identifiers will be added to\nthe framework to express the choice of cipher and MAC algorithms.

The current features provided by the About session-less signal\ndoes not fulfill the Security Manager discovery requirement.  The signal\nprovides the following information:\n1. A number field named state to show the state of the application.  The possible values of this field are:\n    - 0 -- Not claimable.  The application is not claimed and not accepting\n      claim requests.\n    - 1 \u2013 Claimable.  The application is not claimed, but is accepting claim\n      requests.\n    - 2 \u2013 Claimed.  The application is claimed and can be configured.\n    - 3 \u2013 Needs update.  The application is claimed, but requires a\n      configuration update (after a software update).\n2. The public key\n\n\nThis signal is emitted when\n1. The bus attachment is enabled with peer security using ECDHE key exchanges\n2. The application is claimed or do a factory reset\n3. The application has a new manifest template\n\n\nFeatures In Future Releases\n\n\nCertificate revocation (not fully designed)\n\n\nThe application will validate the certificate using a revocation service\nprovided by the Security Manager.  The revocation service is a distributed\nservice.\n\n\nThe Certificate Revocation Service is expected to provide a method call that\ntakes in the certificate and return whether the given certificate is revoked.\n\n\nThe application looks in its installed policy for the peer that provides the\nCertificate Revocation Service.  If the application can\u2019t locate any of the\nCertificate Revocation Service, the certificate revocation check will be\nskipped.\n\n\nIf a membership certificate is revoked, all signed authorization data related to\nthe membership certificate is no longer valid.\n\n\nCurrent work-around\n\n\nThe admin can blacklist a peer by installing a deny rule in the application\npolicy to deny access for the given peer.\n\n\nDistribution of policy updates and membership certificates (not fully designed)\n\n\nThe Distribution Service is a service provided by a Security Manager.  This\nservice provides persistent storage and high availability to distribute updates\nto applications.\n\n\nAn admin uses the Security Manager to generate updated policy and membership\ncertificates, encrypt the payload with a session key derived from a nonce value\nand the master secret for the \n pair.  The package including\nthe sender public key, recipient public key, nonce, and encrypted payload is\nsent to the Distribution Service to delivery to the recipient.  The recipient\nuses the information in the package to locate the master secret to generate the\ncorresponding session key to decrypt the payload.  Once the decryption is\nsuccessful, the recipient signs the hash of the package and provide the\nsignature in the reply.\n\n\n\n\nFigure:\n Distribution of policy update and certificates\n\n\nPolicy Templates\n\n\nAn application developer can define policy templates to help the Security\nManager to build consumer and producer policies.  A policy template provides the\nfollowing data in:\n - Specification version number\n - List of permission rules\n\n\nFuture Considerations\n\n\nBroadcast signals and multipoint sessions\n\n\nAll security enhancements for broadcast signals and multipoint sessions will be\nconsidered in future releases of Security 2.0.",

Updated based on discussion on April 28, 2015. Updated based on discussion on May 5, 2015.    Rev 1 Update 7  May 28, 2015   Simplified access rule selection by removing priority and enforcement explicit deny rules regardless of degree of match. Simplifying to aid in comprehension Corrected text describing policy generated after being claimed to match the specified policy; outgoing messages are allowed for ANY_TRUSTED. Corrected generated policy to indicate there are two entries for members under the ANY_TRUSTED ACL Changed the description of the generated policy to indicate it is not an example, it is the policy to be generated, and recommend certification test be created to verify this. Corrected a couple of places, in definition and description of session establishment, to indicate that membership certificate trust requies a signature chain including the security group authority rather than any certificate authority.

ACL  Access Control List    AES CCM  The Advanced Encryption Standard 128-bit block cypher using Counter with CBC-MAC mode. Refer to  RFC 3610  for more information.    AllJoyn framework  Open source peer-to-peer framework that allows for abstraction of low-level network concepts and APIs.    Authentication GUID  The Authentication GUID is a GUID assigned to a keystore for authentication purposes.  This GUID is persisted in the keystore and provides a long-term identity for the keystore. Typically, this GUID is associated with a single application. In the scenario where a group of related applications share a given keystore, they also share the same authentication GUID. This GUID is used as a mapping key for storing and accessing authentication and encryption keys.   All key materials associated with another peer is stored in the keystore with the peer\u2019s authentication GUID as the mapping key.    Certificate Authority (CA)  Entity that issues a digital certificate    Consumer  An AllJoyn application consuming services on the AllJoyn network.    Device  A physical device that may contain one or more AllJoyn applications.  In this document, whenever the term \u201cdevice\u201d is used, it indicates the system application of the given physical device.    DSA  Digital Signature Algorithm    ECC  Elliptic Curve Cryptography    ECDHE  Elliptic Curve Diffie-Hellman Ephemeral key exchange    ECDHE_ECDSA  ECDHE key agreement with asymmetric DSA based authentication.    ECDHE_NULL  ECDHE key agreement only. No authentication.    ECDHE_PSK  ECDHE key agreement with pre-shared symmetric key based authentication.    Factory-reset application  An application restored to the original configuration.    Grantee  The application or user who is the subject of a certificate.    GUID  Globally Unique Identifier. A 128 bit identifier generated randomly in a way that the probability of collision is negligible.    Subject  The application or user possessing a private key associated with the certificate.    Keystore  A repository of security keys and certificates.  An application instance can have at least one keystore.  A keystore is associated with a bus attachment.  If an application uses multiple bus attachments, it can have more than one keystore. Multiple applications running as the same user can choose to share the same keystore, but if they do, they are treated as the same security principal.    OOB  Out Of Band    Peer  A remote application participating in the AllJoyn messaging.    Permission module  The AllJoyn Core module that handles all the permission authorization.    Producer  An AllJoyn application providing services on the AllJoyn network.    Security Group  A logical grouping of devices, applications, and users. It is identified by a group ID which is a GUID and the security group authority public key. An application can be installed with a policy to expose services to members of the security group. An application or user holding a membership certificate is in fact a member of the security group. Any member of the security group can access the services exposed to the group by the applications with ACLs defined for that group.    Security Group Authority  A security group authority is the user or application that defines the security group and grant membership certificates to other. The security group authority is the certificate authority for that group.    Security Manager  A service used to manage cryptographic keys, and generate and distribute certificates.    SHA-256  Secure Hash Algorithm SHA-2 with digest size of 256 bits or 32 bytes.    User  The person or business entity interacting with AllJoyn applications.",

This\nfeature is part of the AllJoyn Core library.  It is not an option for the\napplication to enforce permission.  It is up to the user to dictate how the\napplication performs based on the access control lists (ACLs) defined for the\napplication.  The AllJoyn Core Permission component does all the enforcement\nincluding the concept of mutual or one-way authorization before any message\naction can be taken.

Using the application manifest template defined by\nthe application developer, the Security Manager builds the manifest consisting\nof access control lists to let the end-user authorize which interactions the\napplication can do.  An application developer does not have to build a security\nmanager.  The permission can be installed by another application or another\nsecurity manager.  In addition to the encrypted messaging (using AES CCM) between the peers, the\nSecurity 2.0 Permission module manages a database of access credentials and the\nAccess Control Lists (ACLs).

Security group specific policy specifies the permissions granted to members of the group. The security group authority becomes a certificate authority for that particular group. A policy may exist at the producer or consumer side. Policy enforcement applies wherever it resides. A policy is considered private.  It is not exchanged with any peer. A keystore has at most one policy.  A complex application with multiple bus attachments can use a shared keystore in one bus attachment and an app-specific keystore for another bus attachment.  In such case, the complex application has in fact more than one policy. An admin can query the existing policy installed in the keystore.

Assumptions  In all the flows listed in this section, the Security Manager is assumed to be\nclaimed by another Security Manager or to be self-claimed.  The certificates may\nhave been issued from sources in the cloud.  As the result, the Security Manager\nis shown with one certificate authority and an identity certificate.  Sample Certificates and Policy Entries  The following is a high level presentation of certificates and policy entries\nused in the flows in this section.   Figure:  Sample Certificates and ACL entries  The peer types  The following peer types are supported in the permission policy.  A peer may match many of the peer types.     Peer Type  Description      ALL  This matches all peers including an anonymous peer using ECDHE_NULL key exchange.    ANY_TRUSTED  This matches any authenticated peer for all authentication methods except ECDHE_NULL key exchange.    FROM_CERTIFICATE_AUTHORITY  This matches any peer authenticated via ECDHE_ECDSA key exchange and its identity certificate\u2019s trust is verified against the specific certificate authority listed in the policy for this type of peer.    WITH_PUBLIC_KEY  This matches a peer with the specific public key.  The peer is authenticated via ECDHE_ECDSA key exchange.  Its identity certificate\u2019s trust is verified against any of the application\u2019s certificate authorities (including the security group authorities).    WITH_MEMBERSHIP  This matches any peer with possession of a membership certificate with the specific security group ID. The peer is authenticated via ECDHE_ECDSA key exchange.  Its identity certificate\u2019s trust is verified against any of the application\u2019s certificate authority (including the security group authorities). The subject of the membership certificate must be the peer\u2019s public key.     Define a security group  Any user can define a security group (logical grouping of applications and\nusers) using a Security Manager. When the user specifies a security group name\n(for display purpose), the Security Manager creates the security group ID\n(a GUID value).  Required Key Exchanges  The framework requires either ECHDE_NULL or ECDHE_PSK key exchange for the claim\nprocess.  Once the application is claimed, only the ECDHE_ECDSA key exchange is\nallowed unless the policy allows for anonymous user; in such case, ECDHE_NULL is\nacceptable.  Certificate exchange during session establishment  During the AllJoyn ECHDE_ECDSA key exchange and session establishment, the peers\nexchange identity certificates, manifests, and all membership certificates.\nSince all the membership certificates are exchanged, there is a potential\ninformation disclosure vulnerability.  It is desired to have a more intelligent\nselection algorithm to provide membership certificates on demand and need-to-know\nbasis.  This algorithm needs to take into account the latency of the certificate\nexchange during the method call invocation.  The bus attachment trusts the peer if the issuer of the peer\u2019s identity\ncertificate is any of its certificate authorities and any of the security group\nauthorities listed in the application\u2019s policy.  After the session key is generated, the peers exchange all the membership\ncertificates.  Each membership certificate\u2019s trust is checked against the\npublic key of the authority of the security group.   Figure:  Exchange manifest and membership certificates  The identity certificate chain is exchanged during the ECDHE_ECDSA key exchange\nprocess.  The org.alljoyn.Bus.Peer.Authentication interface is not enforced with\npermission.  Claim a factory-reset application  Using a Security Manager any user can claim any factory-reset application. The\nfactory-reset application is assumed to be already onboarded to the network.  It\nis recommended the claiming process occurs during the onboarding process while\nthe peers are connected via the SoftAP.   Figure:  Recommend to claim during onboarding  Claiming is a first-come, first-claim action. The user installs an admin\nsecurity group.  The procedure to make the application to become claimable again\nis manufacturer-specific.   See the FactoryReset() in the Configuration\ninterface.  There will be an API call that allows the application to make itself\nclaimable again.  Claim factory-reset application without out-of-band registration data   Figure:  Claim a factory-reset application without using out-of-band\nregistration data  The identity certificate will be used for authentication in the ECDHE_ECDSA key\nexchange.  Claim factory-reset application using out-of-band registration data  An application manufacturer can provision a key or the application can\ndynamically generate a key to support the claiming process. The ECDHE_PSK key\nexchange is used in this scenario. The key is provided to the user out of band.\nAn example is a QR code or a token delivered via email or text messaging. The\nuser is prompted for the key when establishing a connection with the\nfactory-reset application.   Figure:  Claiming a factory-reset application using out-of-band registration\ndata  Example of building a policy  A user uses a Security Manager application to build a policy. The Security\nManager application queries the About data and manifest templates from the\napplication. The Security Manager application can do further introspection of\nthe application for the detailed information of securable interfaces and secured\nobjects, and prompt the user to select the permissions to include in the policy.  A policy may contain a number of ACLs.  Please refer to section (Policy ACL format)  for more information.  Install a policy  An admin can install a policy for the application.  When a policy is installed, the core framework may expire master secrets\nincluding existing session keys if it is not able to apply the new policy without\nre-authenticating the peer.  Resource constrained devices are most likely to\nexpire master secrets.  Expiring keys will cause existing sessions to terminate.   Figure:  Install a policy  Update a manifest  An admin can update a manifest for the application.  This involves resigning the\nidentity certificate because the new digest of the manifest must be included in\nthe identity certificate.   Figure:  Update manifest  Add an application to a security group  An admin issues a membership certificate with the given security group ID and\nprovides it to the application to install in its keystore.

Which peers can be trusted, which\nrights do those peers have\u2026 So after being deployed, applications and devices\nhave to be configured. The people in charge of configuring the system, the\nadministrators need a service for this. Such a service is called a security\nmanager.  Depending on your setup, you need a different service. A large enterprise has\ndifferent requirements than a home does. Not all administrators have a strong\ntechnical background. A tool for home users should have a straightforward,\nunderstandable user interface (hiding the more complex features). These\nsimplifications should be done inside the security manager, so it is transparent\nfor applications and devices in which setup they are deployed. Application\ndevelopers should make no distinction between enterprise and small home.  A security configuration consists of two parts:\n1. Certificates: certificates provide proof that an application is managed by a\n   security manager. They can be used to gain access to resources of other peers\n   or to provide resources themselves to others. The certificates describe the\n   rights the subject has.\n2. Policy: A policy is a list of Access Control Lists (ACLs). These ACLs\n   describe how other peers can access the holder of the policy.  Security managers use AllJoyn to transfer this configuration to applications and\ndevices they manage.  Security Manager Architecture  A security manager is a service that can take multiple forms. For a home setup\nit can be a single application accessed by one person. For an enterprise setup,\nmultiple administrators need to use it, so its core can run on a server, with\nsome local application talking to it. When discussing the functional blocks of\nthe security manager, it is important to understand that those blocks can reside\non different machines and that for some of these we even have multiple instances.   The manager provides certificates. In order to generate and sign certificates,\n  it needs to have a certificate authority (CA).  Configuration storage: The security manager should keep track of what the\n  configuration looks like. To do so, it should persist the configuration data.  UI: The administrator needs to interact with the security manager in order to\n  make configuration changes. The user interface doesn't need to be part of the\n  manager itself. It could be running in a web browser or it could offer a REST\n  API, so that custom UI can be built on top.  AllJoyn Agent (security manager agent): Configuration updates are sent using\n  AllJoyn as the communication protocol. The agent is the component which does\n  the interaction with the managed peers.   The following assumptions are made:  The four functional blocks of the security manager can be combined into a\n  single application, but it should be possible to run them in different\n  applications or even on different hosts.  A security manager can have multiple security manager agents acting on its\n  behalf.  The security manager topology is transparent for AllJoyn applications.  A security manager is identified by the public key of its CA. We call this the\n  key of the security manager.  The Alliance envisions multiple implementations of security managers and does\nnot provide implementation specifications. The Alliance does specify a set of\ninterfaces that allow the security managers to interact with AllJoyn security 2.0\nbased applications and devices.  What the Security Manager manages  We already mentioned a number of times that a security manager manages\napplications and devices. But what does it mean and do we really manage\napplications and devices? The security manager agent will use AllJoyn security\nfeatures to set up a secure connection to a peer. The only way it has to\nsecurely identify this peer is by looking at that peer's public key. Since we\nhand out certificates granting rights to this key, in fact it means we are\nmanaging keys. So when asking what are we managing, we should ask ourselves who\nhas access to a key? There is no easy answer to this questions. It all depends\non the OS and platform the software is running on.   On a plain Linux or Windows machine, applications can choose to protect data\n  on a per-user basis, making it hard to protect the key from other applications\n  running as the same user. On the other hand, the key is also not\n  application-specific. When the same application runs as a different user, it\n  can't access the key anymore.  Operating systems on smartphone do a better job at sandboxing applications.\n  The link between key and application is stronger there.   How many keys you need per device depends on the device:  A single-function device (e.g., a temperature sensor) is considered as one big\n  application. One key to do all operations.  Every app on a smartphone is considered as an app on its own, so one key per\n  application.\n* The built-in firmware of a smart TV is also considered as a single app.\n  Applications installed on top of the firmware of the TV are separate apps and\n  should have their own key.  What we can trust  The AllSeen Alliance offers a software stack that runs on top of some hardware\nwithin an OS. The stack can be embedded in an application which is installed on\na device or could be integrated in a firmware of a device. The security manager\ncannot distinguish this. He only sees a remote peer. Furthermore the security\nmanager cannot assume applications are running on trustworthy systems. If an\napplication runs on a compromised or malicious system, there is little we can do\ninside the app to protect.  A genuine application running on malicious system,\nshould be treated as malicious. We should protect the ecosystem by:   Being able to revoke the rights granted to an application.  Make sure compromised or even malicious applications are limited to rights\n   they were given. Since we can't trust the OS or hardware the application is\n   running on, these checks must be done at the remote peer side.   The protective measure should be defined so that a well-behaving app on a well\nbehaving system can protect itself from any unwarranted access. If both peers\nare malicious, then there is little we can do. But then they don't need AllSeen\nto perform malicious acts. There is a risk though that 2 malicious applications\nteam up. Each individual app gets a small acceptable set of rights, but then\ncombining their rights to launch an attack.  When claiming an application two considerations must be made:   Can I trust the application?  Can I trust the device where the application is running on? But not only the\n   device and its OS, but for desktops systems as well which other applications\n   are there? These apps might to try get access to the keystore of the genuine\n   app. This is not something we can fix within the AllSeen Alliance. This\n   remains an integration aspect   Sharing Keystores  When an application is claimed, it will store its certificates inside a keystore.\nThis keystore can be shared. The security manager nor the system can prevent\napplications from doing this. Is it recommended to share keystores? It has the\nadvantage that you only have to claim one application, while multiple\napplications can use it. However the certificates in the store will only grant a\nlimited set of permission to its users. Sharing the store only makes sense if it\nwas granted all permissions required by its applications. Sharing keystore can\nbe allowed if the applications granted access to it are known upfront and the\nunion of rights is known.  Sharing keystores does have some side effects.  Every app using the keystore\nwill appear as the same manageable application. The security will be able to\nmanage one keystore via multiple apps. This feature requires additional layer of\ncomplexity in order to provide the concurrent access to the shared keystore.  We also partially lose the ability to sandbox applications, as applications\nusing a shared keystore get a full set of rights linked to the store and not\nnecessarily the ones they strictly need.  Applications integrated in firmware  The firmware of a device could consist of multiple smaller AllSeen applications.\nFrom end-user perspective you only want to claim this device once. Those\napplications are allowed to share their keystore, but only one of them should\nprovide the Security interfaces. So only one application is seen from security\nmanager perspective. When expressing the permission required for this\napplication, it should request all permissions required by the apps on that\ndevice.  Standalone applications  Standalone applications are apps downloaded and installed on a desktop computer,\ntablet or smart phone or something similar. Standalone applications should not\nshare their  keystore with other applications. If such an application is built\nout of separate sub-applications (each of them uses a separate bus attachment),\nthen they should follow the same rules as applications integrated in firmware.  Security Manager Operations  The security manager allows the following operations:\n- security group management: create, update and delete security groups\n    - allow grouping of applications. A group is uniquely defined by GUID and\n      the public key of a security manager. Applications can become members of a\n      group when they are issued a membership certificate for that group\n- identity management: create, update and delete identities\n    - Identities are used to define the users of application. Users can map to\n      physical persons.  Applications can act on behalf of a user when they\n      receive an identity certificate for that user\u2019s security manager.  An\n      application keystore should only have one identity certificate.\n- application/key management:\n    - claim applications: make it managed by this security manager\n    - manage application manifest\n    - manage AllJoyn certificates for these applications\n    - manage policy (ACL's) of applications\n    - force application to become un-managed again  Inter Security Manager Interaction  When applications interact with each other, they check if the interaction is\nallowed by their policies as previously set by their security manager. In\npractice, a peer must present a certificate (chain) signed by its security\nmanager public key. Meaning that with the basic features we created silos, you\ncan only talk to applications managed by your own security manager. In practice\napplications managed by different security managers need to interact with each\nother as well. We provide 2 ways to do this: Delegation and Restricted User.  Delegation  Use case  I\u2019m the administrator of my home ecosystem. I claim appliances in the home and\nprovide them with configuration. I as administrator am the only person having\naccess to the security manager. When my kids want to get access to an appliance,\nthen they have to ask me to get approval for each application they want to use.\nThis may not be sufficient for all use cases. With delegation, my security\nmanager gives a membership certificate with delegation rights to the security\nmanager of each of my kids. With this certificate, they can delegate these\nrights to their applications. They only need to ask one time and then they can\nmake any of their applications part of my group. Even though my kids did not\ninteract directly with each other, with these delegated certificates they\ninteract with each other in the scope of this group.  Limitations  The followings are the limitations of using delegation.\n- You can only authenticate members of the group. Mutual authenticated requests\n  can only be done between members of the group.\n- My kids get Remote-control rights for the TV by giving them a membership\n  certificate with delegation rights for my TV Group. Their remote control\n  applications become members of the TV group. If I give my TV a policy for the\n  TV group, then the TV will allow the request from the remote control apps of\n  my kids. This requires my kids to define an ANY-TRUSTED policy for TV\n  operations for their apps. This is ok for TVs remote control operations. If\n  mutual authentication is required, the TV must become member of the TV group\n  as well.\n- For a chat use case you need to know who is sending a message and to whom\n  you\u2019re sending messages. So mutual authentication is required, and all\n  participants have to be in that group.\n- As policy is defined on group level, it would require separate groups in order\n  to differentiate between kids and parents.  Delegating certificate Flow  In the X.509 membership and identity certificates, the delegate concept is\nrepresented by the basicConstraints extension cA flag.  If a grantee receives a\ncertificate with the X.509 basicConstraints extension cA flag equal to true, the\ngrantee can issue a certificate to others.  If the cA flag is false then a peer validating a\ncertificate chain verifies that no further delegation has been done, or the\nchain is considered invalid.   Figure:  Reissue membership certificate  Restricted access for other security manager  Restricted access tries to address the same problem as delegation but takes a\ndifferent approach to solve it. With delegation, you give a certificate to an\napplication. With that certificate the application can prove it is allowed\naccess to a group. With restricted access we define a policy on our managed\napplications that allows applications from a different security manager to get\naccess. This would be as if we would pre-install the delegated membership\ncertificate on all our managed applications. So when the peer comes around, he\ndoesn't need to send the proof, the application already has it. Since policy\ncomes from a trusted source, we don't need to distribute certificates, we can\ndefine a more compact ACL.  In practice, the security manager defines a restricted peer type for all\napplications that need to interact with the applications of the peer security\nmanager. This ACL restricts applications of that security manager to a specific\nset of rules. Those applications just need to prove that they are owned with an\nidentity certificate verifiable with the peer security manager certificate\nauthority. That authority is installed with the restricted peer entry into the\nlocal application policy.  As example use case: Suppose we have a real-estate agent. When showing a house\nto clients, he'd like to show-off the AllSeen-enabled home automation system.\nThis can be achieved with either delegation or restricted user. The advantage of\nrestricted user is that if he potentially needs to show 100 homes, he can do it\nbased on 1 certificate instead of 100 for the delegation scenario. There is less\nrisk for information disclosure. If someone could get hold of the 100\ncertificates, then he can learn who the home sellers are. In the restricted user\ncase, the seller's public keys are in the policy of the agent's app and policy\nis never shared.  Install a restricted peer ACL Flow  The admin installs a FROM_CERTIFICATE_AUTHORITY ACL into his local application\u2019s\npolicy to allow his friend to have access to the local application.   Figure:  Add restricted user rules to an application  Application Manifest  When considering where AllSeen enabled applications will run, smartphones are an\nobvious target. A lot of applications are available in various app stores.\nUnfortunately not all of these applications are trustworthy. For example, the\nflashlight app asks for access to phonebook, network, etc. Same as the\napplication is sandboxed on the smartphone, we would like to sandbox\napplications within the AllSeen security 2.0 context. If I install an AllSeen TV\nremote control app, then I would like it only to have rights to do TV\noperations. Nothing more. Since we can't trust the application, we can't assume\nit will behave properly. So these restrictions must be enforced by the peers.\nFor the remote control example, the TV must check whether the app has\npermissions. When remote control app tries to open the door, then the door must\nreject the call.  The main goal of an application manifest is to inform an admin which interfaces\nan application will produce and consume. Once the admin accepts the manifest,\nthe manifest is signed and installed on the application. The signed manifest\nwill be used to enforce that the application cannot produce or consume any\nunwarranted interfaces.  A signed application manifest limits the potential interfaces a malicious\napplication can access within a set of well-behaving applications.  The application manifest has a similar goal as an application manifest on an app\nstore application, in which an end-user has to accept a list of permissions when\ninstalling a new application on his phone which are enforced by the app store\napplication framework. The implementation is however different, as described\nbelow.  Requirements  Manifest Format  The manifest must be expressed at the interface level. It may be expressed at\nthe member level, but this is not recommended as this increases the complexity\nthat needs to be handled by the admin.  Manifest Acceptance  The manifest template must be presented to the admin in a user-friendly way. As\nthe interface names might not be very informative, they must be mapped to a\nuser-friendly description.  As a malicious application can by definition not be trusted, the descriptions\nmust be provided by a trustworthy source.  The descriptions of the interfaces should be localized to the admin.  The AllSeen Alliance must provide descriptions for any standard AllSeen\ninterface, as reviewed and recommended by the Interface Review Board (IRB).  The application developer must provide the descriptions of any application\nspecific interfaces.  If a manifest template is defined at the member level, a description for each\nlisted member must be available.  Manifest Enforcement  The accepted manifest must be enforced by the peer application, as a malicious\napplication may not be trusted to enforce it locally.  Manifest Update  Whenever an application is updated and does not require additional rights, it\nmay still use the previously signed manifest. Only when the update requires\nadditional rights, the application changes its state and signal the change to\nlet the admin know about the existence of a new manifest template.  The admin\ncan generate a new manifest for that application.  Implementation Scenario  This section describes the steps to generate the application manifest.  Once the\nmanifest is accepted,  its contents digest will be encoded in a new identity\ncertificate.   The security manager discovers the remote application through the\n   NotifyConfig signal.  The security manager retrieves the manifest template of the application.  Using the manifest template, the security manager starts the manifest\n   building process.  The security manager contacts a server via HTTPS to retrieve the human\n   readable description of the interfaces and presents them to the admin.  Note\n   that the HTTPS server location is not yet defined.  The admin accepts (or rejects) the description of the manifest. When the\n   admin rejects the manifest, the application will not receive a manifest.  The security manager reissues a new identity certificate with the digest of\n   the requested (  accepted) permissions.  The security manager installs the new identity certificate and manifest on\n   the application.    Figure:  Building Policy using manifest  Application  The application developer needs to embed the manifest template in his\napplication. There should be a platform specific callback function to retrieve\nthe manifest template that belongs to an application. For app store\napplications, it could be based on convention, providing the manifest template\nas a file inside the application package. For small embedded devices, the\nmanifest template could be part of the application.  To ease the generation of membership certificates by the security manager, the\nmanifest format is the same format that is used to express access rules in the\nmembership certificates.  Interface Description Server  The server serving the descriptions of the interfaces can either be:\n1. Hosted by the application developer for application specific interfaces. To\n   prevent spoofing attacks, this server must be contacted via HTTPS and its URL\n   must be based on the reverse domain name of the interface name.\n2. Hosted by the AllSeen Alliance for common AllSeen interfaces. This server\n   MUST be contacted over HTTPS.  Howeer, the URL for this server is not yet\n   defined.  Manifest Enforcement  When applying the specific policy rules, the remote peer will enforce the rules\nspecified in the manifest since the manifest is associated with the identity\ncertificate.",

Certificates used for ECDHE_ECDSA authentication must\nhave the identity certificate EKU and certificates exchanged to indicate\nsecurity group memberships must have the membership certificate EKU.\n- Intermediate certificates must have zero, one or both identity and membership\nEKUs.\n- No EKU will be treated as any EKU, per RFC 5280. EKU validation is transitive,\nmeaning any certificate with no EKU will inherit those of its parent.\n- Time of validity will only be evaluated if the peer has a time source.\n- The implementation will assume system time is trusted if available.\n- For identity certificates, the associated digest of the leaf certificate\nis validated against the digest of the manifest.\n- The AKI is validated to not be null.\n- CRL check is not implemented as there is no CRL.\n- basicConstraints::pathLenConstraint will NOT be checked.

Security 2.0 Custom OIDs  All Security 2.0 custom OIDs will start with  1.3.6.1.4.1.44924.1  where 1.3.6.1.4.1.44924  is the registered AllSeen Alliance Private Enterprise\nNumber.  Identity certificate  The identity certificate is used to associate application, user or device with\nan identity alias.  This allows an identity alias to have a number of identity\ncertificates installed in different keystores.  The identity alias is encoded in the SubjectAltName field in the extensions.  The extensions include the following fields:\n - ExtendedKeyUsage: the type of certificate within the AllSeen ecosystem. \n 1.3.6.1.4.1.44924.1.1 is used for Identity certificates.\n - SubjectAltName: the alias for the identity.\n - AssociatedDigest: the digest of the associated manifest data.\nBoth the ExtendedKeyUsage and AssociatedDigest have custom OIDs under the\nSecurity 2.0 root.

The security group identifier is encoded with a 16 network byte order octets\nencoded in the SubjectAltName field in the extensions.  The extensions include the following fields:\n- ExtendedKeyUsage: the type of certificate within the AllSeen ecosystem. \n1.3.6.1.4.1.44924.1.5 is used for membership certificates.\n- SubjectAltName: the security group ID.

Currently, these are the AllJoyn\nidentity and membership OIDs listed in this document.  Issuing root certificates\nwith no ExtendedKeyUsage extension or with the anyExtendedKeyUsage OID is\nnot recommended.  Adopting this practice will limit the potential abuse of\nAllJoyn root certificates for unrelated purposes.",

            "text": "AllJoyn\n Security\n\n\nOverview\n\n\nThe AllJoyn system provides a security framework for applications\nto authenticate each other and send encrypted data between them.\nThe AllJoyn framework provides end-to-end application level security.\nAuthentication and data encryption are done at the application.\nThese applications can reside on the same device or on different\ndevices, and can be attached to the same AllJoyn router or\ndifferent AllJoyn routers.\n\n\nNOTE:\n No authentication is done at the AllJoyn router layer.\n\n\nThe AllJoyn framework supports security at the interface level.\nAn application can tag an interface as 'secure' to enable\nauthentication and encryption. All of the methods, signals,\nand properties of a secure interface are considered secure.\nAuthentication- and encryption-related key exchange are\ninitiated on demand when a consumer application invokes a\nmethod call on a secure interface, or explicitly invokes an\nAPI to secure the connection with a remote peer application.\n\n\nThe following figure shows the high-level AllJoyn security architecture.\n\n\n\n\nFigure:\n AllJoyn security architecture\n\n\nAuthentication and encryption is done at the application layer.\nThe AllJoyn core library implements all of the logic for authentication\nand encryption except the Auth Listener. The Auth Listener is a callback\nfunction implemented by the application to provide auth credentials\n(e.g., PIN or password) or verify auth credentials (e.g., verify\ncertificate chain in case of ALLJOYN_ECDHE_ECDSA). Authentication\nand encryption keys are stored in a key store managed by\nthe Security module.\n\n\nNOTE:\n The AllJoyn router is only involved in transmitting\nsecurity-related messages between application endpoints.\nIt does not implement any security logic itself.\n\n\nThe AllJoyn framework uses the Simple Authentication and\nSecurity Layer (SASL) security framework for authentication.\nIt makes use of D-Bus defined SASL protocol\n\nD-Bus Specification\n\nfor exchanging authentication related data.\n\n\nThe AllJoyn framework supports the following auth mechanisms\nfor app-to-app level authentication:\n\n\n\n\nALLJOYN_SRP_KEYX - Secure Remote Password (SRP) key exchange\n\n\nALLJOYN_SRP_LOGON - Secure Remote Password (SRP) logon with username and password\n\n\nALLJOYN_ECDHE_NULL - Elliptic Curve Diffie-Hellman (ephemeral) key exchange\n  with no authentication\n\n\nALLJOYN_ECDHE_PSK -  Elliptic Curve Diffie-Hellman (ephemeral) key exchange\n  authenticated with a pre-shared key (PSK)\n\n\nALLJOYN_ECDHE_ECDSA - Elliptic Curve Diffie-Hellman (ephemeral) key exchange\n  authenticated with an X.509 ECDSA certificate\n\n\n\n\nThe AllJoyn framework also supports ANONYMOUS and EXTERNAL\nauth mechanisms as defined by the D-Bus specification.\n\n\n\n\nThe ANONYMOUS auth mechanism is used between two AllJoyn\nrouters for null authentication. It is also used for authentication\nbetween a thin app and an AllJoyn router.\n\n\nThe EXTERNAL auth mechanism is used between an application\nand the installed AllJoyn router (standalone AllJoyn router)\non the Linux platform.\n\n\n\n\nSecurity changes in the 14.06 release\n\n\nIn the 14.06 release, the ALLJOYN_PIN_KEYX auth mechanism\nis removed from the AllJoyn thin core library. This auth\nmechanism continues to be supported by the AllJoyn standard\ncore library.\n\n\nThe following new Elliptic Curve Diffie-Hellman Ephemeral\n(ECDHE) based auth mechanism are added:\n\n\n\n\nECDHE_NULL is key agreement without authentication\n\n\nECDHE_PSK is a key agreement authenticated with a pre-shared\nsymmetric key.\n\n\nECDHE_ECDSA is a key agreement authenticated with an asymmetric\nkey validated with an ECDSA signature.\n\n\n\n\nThese new auth mechanisms can be used by both thin apps and\nstandard apps. Thin apps in the 14.06 release support only\nECDHE-based auth mechanisms.\n\n\nUse of SASL protocol for authentication is removed from the\nAllJoyn thin core library in the 14.06 release, and will\ncontinue to be supported in AllJoyn standard core library.\n\n\nFor more information about these changes, see the latest version\nof the \nSecurity HLD\n.\n\n\nSecurity changes in the 15.04 release\n\n\nIn the 15.04 release, the ALLJOYN_PIN_KEYX and ALLJOYN_RSA_KEYX authentication\nmechanisms have been removed from the standard client.  Support for ECDSA X.509\nwas added.\n\n\nSecurity concepts\n\n\nThis section defines the AllJoyn security-related concepts.\n\n\nAuthentication (Auth) GUID\n\n\nThe Authentication GUID is a GUID assigned to an application\nfor authentication purposes. This GUID is persisted in the\nkey store and provides a long-term identity for the application.\nTypically, this GUID is associated with a single application.\nIn the scenario where a group of related applications share\na given key store, they also share the same auth GUID.\n\n\nThis GUID is used as a mapping key for storing and accessing\nauthentication and encryption keys for the associated application.\n\n\nMaster secret\n\n\nThe master secret is a key shared between authenticated peer\napplications. Two peer applications generate the same master\nsecret independently, and store it persistently in the key store.\n\n\nThe master secret is stored per Auth GUID for peer applications,\nand has an associated TTL settable by the application.\nAs long as the master secret is valid, peer applications\ndo not have to reauthenticate with each other to exchange encrypted data.\n\n\nThe master secret is 48 bytes in length as per \nRFC 5246\n.\n\n\nSession key\n\n\nA cryptographic key used to encrypt point-to-point data\ntraffic between two peer applications. A separate session key\nis maintained for every connected peer application. A session\nkey is valid as long as peers are connected (over any AllJoyn session).\nIt is a session in the cryptographic sense and not related to\nan AllJoyn session. The same session key is used across all\nAllJoyn sessions between two peers.\n\n\nSession keys are stored in the memory, they are not persisted.\nThe session key is generated after a peer application has been\nauthenticated, and it expires for a peer application when\nthe connection is terminated with that peer. The session key\nis derived from the master secret, and is used to encrypt\nmethod calls, method replies, and unicast signals.\n\n\nThe session key is 128 bits long.\n\n\nNOTE:\n The current implementation has a default TTL of 2 days\nfor session keys. If applications remain connected that long,\nthe associated session key expires and a new session key would\nneed to be generated.\n\n\nGroup key\n\n\nThe group key is a cryptographic key used to encrypt\npoint-to-multipoint data traffic (broadcast signals) sent\nout by a provider application. A single group key is maintained\nby an application to encrypt broadcast signals sent to every\nconnected peer application.\n\n\nA group key is generated when an application generates the\nvery first session key for any connected peer. The group key\nis always generated independent of the provider or consumer\nrole of an application. Only provider applications use the\ngroup key to send out encrypted broadcast signals. Applications\nexchange their group keys using an encrypted method call that\ninvolves the session key.  \n\n\nThe group key is 128 bits long and randomly generated.\nThe group key is directional in nature. Each application has\nits own group key to encrypt broadcast signals. In addition,\nit also maintain a separate peer group key for each of the\nconnected peer for decrypting broadcast signals received from them.\n\n\nGroup keys are stored in the memory, they are not persisted.\nThe group expires when the connection ends with peer\napplications. An application's own group key will expire when\nit no longer has any connections with any of its peers.\nThe group key for a remote peer will expire when the application\nno longer has a connection with that peer.\n\n\nNOTE:\n In future releases, group keys may be persisted to\nsupport encryption for sessionless signals.\n\n\nKey store\n\n\nThe key store is a local storage used to persistently store\nauthentication-related keys, and to store master secret and\nassociated TTL. Applications can provide their own implementation\nof the key store or use the default key store provided by the AllJoyn system.\n\n\nMultiple applications on a device can share a given key store.\nIn this case, those applications share the same set of\nauthentication keys. In the current implementation, content\ninside the key store is encrypted with a key derived from the key store path.\n\n\nFor every authenticated application, the key store maintains\nthe master secret and the associated TTL per Auth GUID of that\napplication. It also maintains the auth GUID assigned to the\nlocal applications that are using the key store.\n\n\nThe following table shows an example key store with master\nsecret stored for two peer applications.\n\n\nKey store example with master secret stored for two peer applications\n\n\nLocal Auth GUID - GUIDx\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPeer Auth GUID\n\n\nMaster secret\n\n\nTTL\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nGUID1\n\n\nMS1\n\n\nT1\n\n\n\n\n\n\nGUID2\n\n\nMS2\n\n\nT2\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nEnd-to-end security flow\n\n\nThe following figure captures the high-level end-to-end\nmessage flow for AllJoyn security for the use case when\ntwo applications have not authenticated with each other\nbefore. The security message flow is initiated based on one\nof the following triggers:\n\n\n\n\nConsumer app invoking a secure method call on a remote\nservice object or\n\n\nConsumer app explicitly invoking an API to secure the\nconnection with the remote peer\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure:\n End-to-end security flow (two applications have not authenticated with each other before)\n\n\nIt is ideal for an application to always explicitly secure\nthe connection with the remote peer. In the case when an\napplication is just interested in receiving secure signals,\nthat is the only way to secure the connection with the\nremote peer in order to receive keys for decrypting signals.\n\n\nThe AllJoyn core library attached with the application\nimplements all of the AllJoyn security logic. The AllJoyn\nrouter only acts as a pass-through for security-related messages.\nEach application needs to invoke EnablePeerSecurity API call\nwith the AllJoyn core library to enable AllJoyn security.\nThe application specifies authentication mechanism to be used,\nthe Auth Listener for callback and the key store file as part\nof this API call. It also indicates whether key store can\nbe shared. The AllJoyn core library generates the auth GUID\nfor the application as part of first-time initialization of\nthe key store. The auth GUID gets stored in the key store.\n\n\nAfter establishing a session with the provider app, the consumer\napp initiates one of the security triggers mentioned above.\nThe AllJoyn Core library checks to see if authentication\nis already in progress.\n\n\n\n\nIf yes, it stops.\n\n\nIf no, it continues with the security flow.\n\n\n\n\nIt looks for the key material for remote peer. In this case,\nsince this is the first secure interaction with the remote\napp, no key material is found. This will trigger security\nflow with the remote peer.\n\n\nThe message flow consists of following four distinct\nsteps in that order:\n\n\n\n\nExchange Auth GUIDs: This step involves exchanging Auth\nGUIDs between peer applications. Once learned, the remote\napp auth GUID is used to see if the master secret is present\nfor that auth GUID in the key store. In this case, no master\nsecret is found since the two apps have not authenticated\nwith each other.\n\n\nApp-to-App authentication: This step involves two peers\nauthenticating each other using one of the supported auth\nmechanisms. At the end of this step, two peers have authenticated\neach other and now share a common master key.\n\n\nGenerate a session key: This step involves two peers\ngenerating a session key to be used for encrypting secure\npoint-to-point messages between them. The session key is\ngenerated independently by both the peers based on the\nshared master key. A group key is also generated when the\nfirst session key is generated.\n\n\nExchange group keys: This step involves two peers exchanging\ntheir own group keys with each other via an encrypted\nAllJoyn message. The AllJoyn message gets encrypted using\nthe session key already established between two peers.\nThe group key is used by the application to encrypt session\nmulticast and broadcast signals. At the end of this step,\ntwo peer applications have group keys to decrypt secure\nbroadcast signals received from each other.\n\n\n\n\nDetails for each of these steps are described in the\nfollowing sections. After completing these steps, peer\napplications have now established encryption/decryption\nkeys to exchange encrypted method calls and signals.\n\n\nThese keys are managed as part of a peer state table\nwhich includes a unique name for the remote peer, as well\nas a local auth GUID and group key for the current application.\n\n\nThe following table provides a sample peer state table with\nkeys stored for two authenticated peer applications.\n\n\nSample peer state table for two authenticated peer applications.\n\n\nLocal Auth GUID - GUIDx\n\n\nApp Group Key - GKx\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPeer Auth GUID\n\n\nUnique name\n\n\nSession key\n\n\nPeer group key\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nGUID1\n\n\n:100.2\n\n\nSK1\n\n\nGK1\n\n\n\n\n\n\nGUID2\n\n\n:200.2\n\n\nSK2\n\n\nGK2\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAlready authenticated apps\n\n\nWhen apps connect with each other subsequent to their first\nconnection, they do not need to authenticate again with each\nother if the master secret is still valid. The following figure\nshows security flow for this use case.\n\n\n\n\nFigure:\n Authenticated apps connecting again\n\n\nIn this case, since the apps were not connected, no key material\nis found for the remote peer. As a result, the consumer app\nperforms the Exchange Auth GUIDs step with the remote peer.\nThis retrieves the Auth GUID for the remote peer that can\nbe used for lookup in the key store file.\n\n\nSince the apps have already authenticated, a master secret\nis found in the key store for the auth GUID of the provider\napp and no app-to-app authentication needs to occur.\nThe consumer app directly goes to the next step of generating\nsession key and/or group key.\n\n\nNOTE:\n If the verification step fails during session key\ngeneration, the consumer app must re-authenticate with\nthe provider even if master secret is still valid.\n\n\nExchange of Auth GUIDs\n\n\nThe following figure shows the message flow for the exchange\nof Auth GUIDs between peer applications.\n\n\n\n\nFigure:\n Exchange of Auth GUIDs\n\n\nThe message flow steps are described below.\n\n\n\n\nThe consumer app generates an ExchangeGuids METHOD_CALL\nmessage and sends it to the provider app via the AllJoyn router.\nThis message includes the Auth GUID of the consumer app and\nthe maximum Auth version supported by the consumer app.\n\n\nThe provider app proposes its max auth version if it\ndoes not support the auth version received from the consumer app.\n\n\nThe provider app generates an ExchangeGuids METHOD_RETURN\nmessage and sends it to the consumer app via the AllJoyn router.\nThis message includes the Auth GUID of the provider app and\nthe max auth version of the provider app.\n\n\nThe consumer app verifies that it supports the received\nauth version. This completes the Exchange GUIDs step.\n\n\n\n\nApp-to-app authentication\n\n\nAllJoyn peer applications authenticate each other using\none of the auth mechanisms detailed in this section.\nThese auth mechanisms are designed based on the security\nconstructs in \nRFC 5246\n and\n\nRFC 5054\n. Applicable RFC\nsections are listed when describing details for these auth mechanisms.\n\n\nNOTE:\n For the authentication message flows captured in this section,\nthe consumer and provider apps are also referred to as client\nand server respectively, to correspond with terminology used\nin \nRFC 5246\n and\n\nRFC 5054\n.\n\n\nUse of D-Bus SASL protocol\n\n\nThe AllJoyn framework implements the D-Bus SASL exchange protocol\n\nD-Bus Specification\n to exchange\nauthentication-related data. All authentication-related\nexchanges are done using the AuthChallenge method call/reply\ndefined as part of the org.alljoyn.Bus.Peer.Authentication\ninterface implemented by the AllJoyn core library.\n\n\nAuth data to be exchanged is generated as a SASL string\nbased on the D-Bus SASL exchange protocol. Auth data inside\nthe SASL string is sent in the hex form. The generated string\nis then passed as a parameter to the AuthChallenge method call\nor method reply.\n\n\nFor example, to initiate authentication for ALLJOYN_SRP_KEYX,\ngenerated string would be:\n\n\nAUTH ALLJOYN_SRP_KEYX \nc_rand in hex\n\n\n\n\n\nThis includes the SASL AUTH command, auth mechanism, and auth data in hex form.\n\n\nThe following table captures the D-Bus SASL commands supported\nby the AllJoyn framework.\n\n\nD-Bus SASL commands supported by the AllJoyn framework\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nCommand\n\n\nDirection\n\n\nDescription\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAUTH [mechanism] [initial-response]\n\n\nConsumer-\nProvider\n\n\nStart the authentication.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nCANCEL\n\n\nConsumer-\nProvider\n\n\nCancel the authentication.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nBEGIN\n\n\nConsumer-\nProvider\nProvider-\nConsumer\n\n\nOn the consumer side, acknowledge that the consumer has received an OK command from the provider, and that the stream of messages is about to begin.\nFrom the provider side, sent by the provider as response to BEGIN command from the consumer.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nDATA\n\n\nConsumer-\nProvider\nProvider-\nConsumer\n\n\nOn the consumer or provider side, contains a hex-encoded block of data to be interpreted according to the auth mechanism in use.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nOK\n\n\nConsumer-\nProvider\n\n\nThe client has been authenticated.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nREJECTED\n\n\nConsumer-\nProvider\n\n\nOn the consumer side, indicates that the current authentication exchange has failed, and further exchange of DATA is inappropriate.

This auth mechanism is primarily designed for use\ncases where a one-time use password is generated by both sides.\n\n\n\n\nFigure:\n ALLJOYN_SRP_KEYX auth mechanism\n\n\nThe message flow steps are described below.\n\n\n\n\nThe consumer app generates a 28 bytes client random string c_rand.\n\n\nThe consumer (client) app generates an AuthChallenge METHOD_CALL\nmessage and passes \"AUTH ALLJOYN_SRP_KEYX \nc_rand\n\" as parameter\nin that message. The consumer app sends the method call to the\nprovider (server) app via the AllJoyn router.\n\n\nThe provider app invokes the AuthListener callback registered\nby the application to request for a password. The AuthListener\nreturns the password.

            "text": "The AllJoyn system provides a security framework for applications\nto authenticate each other and send encrypted data between them.\nThe AllJoyn framework provides end-to-end application level security.\nAuthentication and data encryption are done at the application.\nThese applications can reside on the same device or on different\ndevices, and can be attached to the same AllJoyn router or\ndifferent AllJoyn routers.  NOTE:  No authentication is done at the AllJoyn router layer.  The AllJoyn framework supports security at the interface level.\nAn application can tag an interface as 'secure' to enable\nauthentication and encryption. All of the methods, signals,\nand properties of a secure interface are considered secure.\nAuthentication- and encryption-related key exchange are\ninitiated on demand when a consumer application invokes a\nmethod call on a secure interface, or explicitly invokes an\nAPI to secure the connection with a remote peer application.  The following figure shows the high-level AllJoyn security architecture.   Figure:  AllJoyn security architecture  Authentication and encryption is done at the application layer.\nThe AllJoyn core library implements all of the logic for authentication\nand encryption except the Auth Listener. The Auth Listener is a callback\nfunction implemented by the application to provide auth credentials\n(e.g., PIN or password) or verify auth credentials (e.g., verify\ncertificate chain in case of ALLJOYN_ECDHE_ECDSA). Authentication\nand encryption keys are stored in a key store managed by\nthe Security module.  NOTE:  The AllJoyn router is only involved in transmitting\nsecurity-related messages between application endpoints.\nIt does not implement any security logic itself.  The AllJoyn framework uses the Simple Authentication and\nSecurity Layer (SASL) security framework for authentication.\nIt makes use of D-Bus defined SASL protocol D-Bus Specification \nfor exchanging authentication related data.  The AllJoyn framework supports the following auth mechanisms\nfor app-to-app level authentication:   ALLJOYN_SRP_KEYX - Secure Remote Password (SRP) key exchange  ALLJOYN_SRP_LOGON - Secure Remote Password (SRP) logon with username and password  ALLJOYN_ECDHE_NULL - Elliptic Curve Diffie-Hellman (ephemeral) key exchange\n  with no authentication  ALLJOYN_ECDHE_PSK -  Elliptic Curve Diffie-Hellman (ephemeral) key exchange\n  authenticated with a pre-shared key (PSK)  ALLJOYN_ECDHE_ECDSA - Elliptic Curve Diffie-Hellman (ephemeral) key exchange\n  authenticated with an X.509 ECDSA certificate   The AllJoyn framework also supports ANONYMOUS and EXTERNAL\nauth mechanisms as defined by the D-Bus specification.   The ANONYMOUS auth mechanism is used between two AllJoyn\nrouters for null authentication. It is also used for authentication\nbetween a thin app and an AllJoyn router.  The EXTERNAL auth mechanism is used between an application\nand the installed AllJoyn router (standalone AllJoyn router)\non the Linux platform.   Security changes in the 14.06 release  In the 14.06 release, the ALLJOYN_PIN_KEYX auth mechanism\nis removed from the AllJoyn thin core library. This auth\nmechanism continues to be supported by the AllJoyn standard\ncore library.  The following new Elliptic Curve Diffie-Hellman Ephemeral\n(ECDHE) based auth mechanism are added:   ECDHE_NULL is key agreement without authentication  ECDHE_PSK is a key agreement authenticated with a pre-shared\nsymmetric key.  ECDHE_ECDSA is a key agreement authenticated with an asymmetric\nkey validated with an ECDSA signature.   These new auth mechanisms can be used by both thin apps and\nstandard apps. Thin apps in the 14.06 release support only\nECDHE-based auth mechanisms.  Use of SASL protocol for authentication is removed from the\nAllJoyn thin core library in the 14.06 release, and will\ncontinue to be supported in AllJoyn standard core library.

            "text": "This section defines the AllJoyn security-related concepts.  Authentication (Auth) GUID  The Authentication GUID is a GUID assigned to an application\nfor authentication purposes. This GUID is persisted in the\nkey store and provides a long-term identity for the application.\nTypically, this GUID is associated with a single application.\nIn the scenario where a group of related applications share\na given key store, they also share the same auth GUID.  This GUID is used as a mapping key for storing and accessing\nauthentication and encryption keys for the associated application.  Master secret  The master secret is a key shared between authenticated peer\napplications. Two peer applications generate the same master\nsecret independently, and store it persistently in the key store.  The master secret is stored per Auth GUID for peer applications,\nand has an associated TTL settable by the application.\nAs long as the master secret is valid, peer applications\ndo not have to reauthenticate with each other to exchange encrypted data.  The master secret is 48 bytes in length as per  RFC 5246 .  Session key  A cryptographic key used to encrypt point-to-point data\ntraffic between two peer applications. A separate session key\nis maintained for every connected peer application. A session\nkey is valid as long as peers are connected (over any AllJoyn session).\nIt is a session in the cryptographic sense and not related to\nan AllJoyn session. The same session key is used across all\nAllJoyn sessions between two peers.  Session keys are stored in the memory, they are not persisted.\nThe session key is generated after a peer application has been\nauthenticated, and it expires for a peer application when\nthe connection is terminated with that peer. The session key\nis derived from the master secret, and is used to encrypt\nmethod calls, method replies, and unicast signals.  The session key is 128 bits long.  NOTE:  The current implementation has a default TTL of 2 days\nfor session keys. If applications remain connected that long,\nthe associated session key expires and a new session key would\nneed to be generated.  Group key  The group key is a cryptographic key used to encrypt\npoint-to-multipoint data traffic (broadcast signals) sent\nout by a provider application. A single group key is maintained\nby an application to encrypt broadcast signals sent to every\nconnected peer application.  A group key is generated when an application generates the\nvery first session key for any connected peer. The group key\nis always generated independent of the provider or consumer\nrole of an application. Only provider applications use the\ngroup key to send out encrypted broadcast signals. Applications\nexchange their group keys using an encrypted method call that\ninvolves the session key.    The group key is 128 bits long and randomly generated.\nThe group key is directional in nature. Each application has\nits own group key to encrypt broadcast signals. In addition,\nit also maintain a separate peer group key for each of the\nconnected peer for decrypting broadcast signals received from them.  Group keys are stored in the memory, they are not persisted.\nThe group expires when the connection ends with peer\napplications. An application's own group key will expire when\nit no longer has any connections with any of its peers.\nThe group key for a remote peer will expire when the application\nno longer has a connection with that peer.  NOTE:  In future releases, group keys may be persisted to\nsupport encryption for sessionless signals.  Key store  The key store is a local storage used to persistently store\nauthentication-related keys, and to store master secret and\nassociated TTL. Applications can provide their own implementation\nof the key store or use the default key store provided by the AllJoyn system.  Multiple applications on a device can share a given key store.\nIn this case, those applications share the same set of\nauthentication keys. In the current implementation, content\ninside the key store is encrypted with a key derived from the key store path.  For every authenticated application, the key store maintains\nthe master secret and the associated TTL per Auth GUID of that\napplication. It also maintains the auth GUID assigned to the\nlocal applications that are using the key store.  The following table shows an example key store with master\nsecret stored for two peer applications.

            "text": "The following figure captures the high-level end-to-end\nmessage flow for AllJoyn security for the use case when\ntwo applications have not authenticated with each other\nbefore. The security message flow is initiated based on one\nof the following triggers:   Consumer app invoking a secure method call on a remote\nservice object or  Consumer app explicitly invoking an API to secure the\nconnection with the remote peer    Figure:  End-to-end security flow (two applications have not authenticated with each other before)  It is ideal for an application to always explicitly secure\nthe connection with the remote peer. In the case when an\napplication is just interested in receiving secure signals,\nthat is the only way to secure the connection with the\nremote peer in order to receive keys for decrypting signals.  The AllJoyn core library attached with the application\nimplements all of the AllJoyn security logic. The AllJoyn\nrouter only acts as a pass-through for security-related messages.\nEach application needs to invoke EnablePeerSecurity API call\nwith the AllJoyn core library to enable AllJoyn security.\nThe application specifies authentication mechanism to be used,\nthe Auth Listener for callback and the key store file as part\nof this API call. It also indicates whether key store can\nbe shared. The AllJoyn core library generates the auth GUID\nfor the application as part of first-time initialization of\nthe key store. The auth GUID gets stored in the key store.  After establishing a session with the provider app, the consumer\napp initiates one of the security triggers mentioned above.\nThe AllJoyn Core library checks to see if authentication\nis already in progress.   If yes, it stops.  If no, it continues with the security flow.   It looks for the key material for remote peer. In this case,\nsince this is the first secure interaction with the remote\napp, no key material is found. This will trigger security\nflow with the remote peer.  The message flow consists of following four distinct\nsteps in that order:   Exchange Auth GUIDs: This step involves exchanging Auth\nGUIDs between peer applications. Once learned, the remote\napp auth GUID is used to see if the master secret is present\nfor that auth GUID in the key store. In this case, no master\nsecret is found since the two apps have not authenticated\nwith each other.  App-to-App authentication: This step involves two peers\nauthenticating each other using one of the supported auth\nmechanisms. At the end of this step, two peers have authenticated\neach other and now share a common master key.  Generate a session key: This step involves two peers\ngenerating a session key to be used for encrypting secure\npoint-to-point messages between them. The session key is\ngenerated independently by both the peers based on the\nshared master key. A group key is also generated when the\nfirst session key is generated.  Exchange group keys: This step involves two peers exchanging\ntheir own group keys with each other via an encrypted\nAllJoyn message. The AllJoyn message gets encrypted using\nthe session key already established between two peers.\nThe group key is used by the application to encrypt session\nmulticast and broadcast signals. At the end of this step,\ntwo peer applications have group keys to decrypt secure\nbroadcast signals received from each other.   Details for each of these steps are described in the\nfollowing sections. After completing these steps, peer\napplications have now established encryption/decryption\nkeys to exchange encrypted method calls and signals.  These keys are managed as part of a peer state table\nwhich includes a unique name for the remote peer, as well\nas a local auth GUID and group key for the current application.  The following table provides a sample peer state table with\nkeys stored for two authenticated peer applications.  Sample peer state table for two authenticated peer applications.

NOTE:  For the authentication message flows captured in this section,\nthe consumer and provider apps are also referred to as client\nand server respectively, to correspond with terminology used\nin  RFC 5246  and RFC 5054 .  Use of D-Bus SASL protocol  The AllJoyn framework implements the D-Bus SASL exchange protocol D-Bus Specification  to exchange\nauthentication-related data. All authentication-related\nexchanges are done using the AuthChallenge method call/reply\ndefined as part of the org.alljoyn.Bus.Peer.Authentication\ninterface implemented by the AllJoyn core library.  Auth data to be exchanged is generated as a SASL string\nbased on the D-Bus SASL exchange protocol. Auth data inside\nthe SASL string is sent in the hex form. The generated string\nis then passed as a parameter to the AuthChallenge method call\nor method reply.  For example, to initiate authentication for ALLJOYN_SRP_KEYX,\ngenerated string would be:  AUTH ALLJOYN_SRP_KEYX  c_rand in hex   This includes the SASL AUTH command, auth mechanism, and auth data in hex form.

The consumer tries another mechanism, or tries providing different responses to challenges.    ERROR  Consumer- Provider Provider- Consumer  On the consumer or provider side, either the provider or consumer did not know a command, does not accept the given command in the current context, or did not understand the arguments to the command.     ALLJOYN_SRP_KEYX  The following figure shows the message flow for the ALLJOYN_SRP_KEYX\nauth mechanism. This auth mechanism is primarily designed for use\ncases where a one-time use password is generated by both sides.   Figure:  ALLJOYN_SRP_KEYX auth mechanism  The message flow steps are described below.   The consumer app generates a 28 bytes client random string c_rand.  The consumer (client) app generates an AuthChallenge METHOD_CALL\nmessage and passes \"AUTH ALLJOYN_SRP_KEYX  c_rand \" as parameter\nin that message. The consumer app sends the method call to the\nprovider (server) app via the AllJoyn router.  The provider app invokes the AuthListener callback registered\nby the application to request for a password. The AuthListener\nreturns the password. A username of \"anonymous\" is used in this case.  The provider app computes the server's public value B as\nper the algorithm in section 2.5.3 of  RFC 5054 .  The provider app generates an AuthChallenge METHOD_RETURN\nmessage to send a server key exchange message to the client.\nThe provider app passes \"DATA  N:g:s:B \" as parameter to that\nmessage. Refer to section 2.5.3 of  RFC 5054 .\nThe 's' is a 40 bytes random salt value. The provider app\nsends method reply to the consumer app via the AllJoyn router.  The consumer app validates the values of N, g, s and B per\nsection 2.5.3 of  RFC 5054 .  The consumer app computes the client's public value A per\nsection 2.5.4 of  RFC 5054 .  The consumer (client) app generates an AuthChallenge METHOD_CALL\nmessage and passes \"DATA  A \" as parameter in that message.\nThe consumer app sends the method call to the provider (server)\napp via the AllJoyn router.  The provider app generates a 28 bytes server random string s_rand.  The provider app computes a premaster secret using the\nalgorithm in section 2.6 of  RFC 5054 .\nThe premaster secret is based on the client's public value (A),\nthe server's public value (B), and password among other parameters.  The provider app computes a master secret based on\nthe premaster secret, c_rand, and s_rand as per the algorithm\nin section 8.1 of  RFC 5246 .  The provider app computes a \"server finish\" s_verifier as\nper the algorithm in section 7.4.9 of  RFC 5246 . \nThe s_verifier is generated based on master secret, hash of\nhandshake messages, and \"server finish\" label.  The provider app generates an AuthChallenge METHOD_RETURN\nmessage and passes \"DATA  s_rand:s_verfier \" as parameter\nto that message. The provider app sends the method reply\nto the consumer app via the AllJoyn router.  The consumer app invokes the AuthListener callback\nregistered by the application to request for a password.\nThe AuthListener returns the password. A username of \"anonymous\"\nis used in this case.  The consumer app computes a premaster secret using the\nalgorithm in section 2.6 of  RFC 5054 .\nThe premaster secret is based on the client's public value (A),\nthe server's public value (B), and the password among other parameters.  The consumer app computes a master secret based on the\npremaster secret, c_rand, and s_rand as per the algorithm\nin section 8.1 of  RFC 5246 .  The consumer app generates the \"server finish\" verifier\nusing the same algorithm as the provider app and verifies\nthat the computed value is same as the received s_verifier.  The consumer app computes a \"client finish\" c_verifier\nas per the algorithm in section 7.4.9 of  RFC 5246 .\nThe c_verifier is generated based on the master secret,\nhash of handshake messages, and \"client finish\" label.  The consumer app generates an AuthChallenge METHOD_CALL\nmessage to send the c_verifier to the server. The consumer app\npasses \"DATA  c_verifier \" as parameter to the method call.\nThe consumer app sends the method call to the provider (server)\napp via the AllJoyn router.  The provider app generates the \"client finish\" verifier\nusing the same algorithm as the consumer app and verifies\nthat the computed value is same as the received c_verifier.\n   At this point, the client and server have authenticated with each other.  The provider app generates an AuthChallenge METHOD_RETURN\nmessage indicating that authentication is complete. The provider\napp passes \"OK  s_GUID \" as parameter in that message, where s_GUID\nis the auth GUID of the provider app. The provider app sends\nthe method reply to the consumer app via the AllJoyn router.  The consumer app sends an AuthChallenge METHOD_CALL to t\nhe provider app specifying \"BEGIN  c_GUID \" as parameter.\nThis indicates to the provider that the client has received\nthe OK message, and the stream of data messages is about to begin.\nThe c_GUID is auth GUID of the consumer app.  The provider app sends an AuthChallenge METHOD_RETURN\nmessage, specifying \"BEGIN\" as parameter.   ALLJOYN_SRP_LOGON  The following figure shows the message flow for the ALLJOYN_SRP_LOGON\nauth mechanism. This auth mechanism is designed for client-server use\ncases where server maintains username and password, and the client\nuses this information for authentication. This mechanism is quite\nsimilar to the AllJoyn_SRP_KEYX auth mechanism with the following differences:   The consumer app invokes the AuthListener callback up front\nto request the username and password from the application.\nThe consumer app then passes the username in the first AuthChallenge\nmessage sent to the provider app.  The provider app uses the received username to request for\npassword from the AuthListener.

service object path, unique name of the provider app \nand sessionId information are provided to create a proxy object. \n\n\nTo receive signals from the provider app, consumer app \nregisters specific signal handlers with the AllJoyn router \nfor signal names specified in the service object. \n\n\nWhen a particular signal is received, specified signal \nhandler gets invoked.\n\n\nThe consumer application endpoint connected to the AllJoyn \nrouter has one associated unique name. \n\n\nThe AllJoyn router maintains session-related state information \nfor the joined sessions. This information is used to perform \nsessionId based routing for AllJoyn messages.\n\n\n\n\nData exchange via methods\n\n\nThe following use cases illustrate data exchange via method calls:\n\n\n\n\nProvider app sending a reply\n\n\nProvider app not sending a reply\n\n\n\n\nProvider app sending a reply\n\n\nThe following figure captures the message flow for the scenario \nwhen a consumer app remotely invokes a method call on the \nprovider app to exchange data. A METHOD_RETURN reply message \nis sent back to the consumer app.\n\n\n\n\nFigure:\n Data exchange via method calls (reply sent)\n\n\nThe message flow steps are described below.\n\n\n\n\nBoth the provider and consumer apps connect to the AllJoyn \nrouter and perform advertisement and discovery steps to \ndiscover desired services.\n\n\nThe provider app registers its service objects with the \nAllJoyn core library. This step is needed to expose service \nobjects to remote nodes on the network. The AllJoyn core library \nadds a MethodHandler for all the methods associated with a \ngiven service object.\n\n\nThe provider app binds a session port with the AllJoyn \nrouter via the AllJoyn core library's BindSessionPort API. \nThis call specifies a session port, session options and a \nSessionPortListener for the session.\n\n\nThe provider and consumer apps perform AllJoyn service \nadvertisement and discovery to discover the service offered \nby the provider app.\n\n\nThe consumer app establishes an AllJoyn session with the \nprovider app over the bound session port. Now there is a \nsession connection established between provider and consumer \napp to exchange data.\n\n\nThe consumer app creates a proxyBusObect via the AllJoyn \ncore library's GetProxyBusObjcet API. The app specifies unique \nname of provider app, object path for the service object, \nsessionId, and list of BusInterfaces to which the proxy \nobject should respond.\n\n\nThe consumer app gets the BusInterface from the created \nproxy object and calls a method on this BusInterface. \nThe app provides input parameters for the method.\n\n\nThe ProxyBusObject:MethodCall method is called, which \ngenerates an AllJoyn METHOD_CALL message for the method call.\n\n\nThe proxy object sends the generated METHOD_CALL message \nto the AllJoyn router.\n\n\nThe AllJoyn router receives the message and determines \nwhere this message needs to be routed based on the \nsession ID/destination information included in the message. \nIn this case, the message needs to be routed to remote \nAllJoyn router endpoint at the provider.\n\n\nThe AllJoyn router sends the METHOD_CALL message to the \nremote AllJoyn router over the established session connection. \nThe METHOD_CALL message includes a serial number, service \nobjectPath, interfaceName in the service object, member name \n(method name) within the interfaceName, sessionId, and sender \nunique name as part of the header fields of the message. \nThe method input parameters are included as part of the message body.\n\n\nThe provider AllJoyn router receives the METHOD_CALL \nmessage. It determines where this message needs to be \nrouted based on the session ID/destination information. \nIn this case, the message needs to be routed to the AllJoyn \ncore library app endpoint. \n\n\nThe AllJoyn router sends the METHOD_CALL message to \nthe AllJoyn core library endpoint. \n\n\nThe AllJoyn core library invokes the registered MethodHandler \nfor the method call member specified in the received message. \nThe MethodHandler invokes the actual method call with the \nBusInterface of the service object and receives the method \nresponse. It generates a METHOD_RETURN message for the method \nreply and sends to the AllJoyn router. \n\n\nThe AllJoyn router receives the METHOD_RETURN message \nand determines where this message needs to be routed based \non session ID/destination information included in the message. \nIn this case, the message needs to be routed to the remote \nAllJoyn router endpoint at the consumer.\n\n\nThe provider AllJoyn router sends the METHOD_RETURN \n   message to the remote AllJoyn router over established \n   session connection. The METHOD_RETURN message includes a \n   reply serial number (serial number of the associated METHOD_CALL \n   message), sessionId, and sender's unique name as part of \n   message header fields.  Any output parameters for the \n   METHOD_RETURN message is specified as part of the message body.\n\n\nThe consumer AllJoyn router receives the METHOD_RETURN \n  message. It determines where this message needs to be routed \n  based on the session ID/destination information. In this case, \n  the message needs to be routed to the app endpoint.\n\n\nThe AllJoyn router sends the METHOD_RETURN message to the \n  application's endpoint with output parameters as the response \n  to the original METHOD_CALL message. If the METHOD_CALL message \n  was sent asynchronously, a ReplyHandler gets registered which \n  is invoked when the METHOD_RETURN message is received.\n\n\n\n\nProvider app not sending a reply\n\n\nWhen defining an interface definition, the provider can annotate \nsome methods that are not returning any output parameters as \nNO_REPLY_EXPECTED. For such methods, the provider app will not \nbe sending any METHOD_RETURN message back to the consumer. \nWhen invoking such a method, the consumer should set the NO_REPLY_EXPECTED \nflag to indicate to the AllJoyn core library that it does \nnot need to start a timer and wait for a reply from the provider.\n\n\nThe following figure shows the message flow for the scenario \nwhen a method is invoked with the NO_REPLY_EXPECTED flag set, \nand no reply is sent by the provider app.\n\n\n\n\nFigure:\n Data exchange via method calls (reply not sent)\n\n\nMost of the message flow steps are similar to the reply sent \nmessage flow returning a method reply. The following captures \nthe distinguishing steps with respect to that flow.\n\n\n\n\nWhen defining a service interface, provider app annotates \none or more methods in the interface as NO_REPLY_EXPECTED. \nThe service object implementing the service interface gets \nregistered with the AllJoyn core library.\n\n\nOn the consumer side, when that method call is invoked \nvia ProxyObject interfaces, the consumer sets the NO_REPLY_EXPECTED \nflag. This indicates to the AllJoyn core library that it does \nnot need to start a timer and wait for a reply from the provider.\n\n\nThe METHOD_CALL message reaches the provider app and the \nassociated method gets invoked. Since the method was annotated \nwith NO_REPLY_EXPECTED, the provider app does not generate any reply.\n\n\n\n\nData exchange via signals\n\n\nThe following figure captures the message flow for the scenario \nwhen consumer app registers to receive signals from the provider \napp to exchange data. \n\n\n\n\nFigure:\n Data exchange via signals\n\n\nA signal gets forwarded to all participants in a session if \nonly sessionId is specified in the header (no destination field). \n\n\nIf a specific destination is specified in the header field, \nthen the signal is only sent to that participant.\n\n\nThe message flow steps are described below.\n\n\n\n\nBoth the provider and consumer apps connect to the AllJoyn \nrouter and perform advertisement and discovery steps to \ndiscover desired services.\n\n\nThe provider app registers its service objects with the \nAllJoyn core library. This step is needed to expose service \nobjects to remote nodes on the network. The AllJoyn core \nlibrary adds a MethodHandler for all the methods associated \nwith a given service object.\n\n\nThe provider app binds a session port with the AllJoyn \nrouter via the AllJoyn core library's BindSessionPort API. \nThis call specifies a session port, session options, and a \nSessionPortListener for the session.\n\n\nThe provider and consumer apps perform AllJoyn service \nadvertisement and discovery to discover the service offered \nby the provider app.\n\n\nThe consumer app establishes an AllJoyn session with \nthe provider app over the bound session port. Now there \nis a session connection established between provider and \nconsumer app to exchange data.\n\n\nThe consumer app registers a signal handler for receiving \nspecific signal from the provider side service object by \ninvoking RegisterSignalHandler API with the AllJoyn core library. \nThe app specifies the interface name for the interface which \nincludes the signal, name of the signal, object path for \nthe object receiving the signal, signal handler method, \nand source object path for signal emitter.\n\n\nThe AllJoyn core library invokes an AddMatch call with \nthe AllJoyn router to register the rule to receive this signal. \nThis rule specifies type=signal, interface name, signal \nmember name, and source object path for the object generating the signal.\n\n\nWhen the provider app has the signal to send, it invokes \nthe BusObject Signal(...) call specifying all the signal \nparameters. This call generates an AllJoyn SIGNAL message. \n\n\nThe SIGNAL message gets sent to the AllJoyn router. \n\n\nThe AllJoyn router receives the SIGNAL message and \ndetermines where this message needs to be routed based \non the session ID/destination information included in the \nmessage. In this case, the message needs to be routed to \nremote AllJoyn router endpoint at the consumer.\n\n\nThe consumer AllJoyn router receives the signal and \nfilters it based on registered match rules. In this case, \nthe signal matches the registered rule. The AllJoyn router \nsends the received SIGNAL message to the AllJoyn core library app endpoint.\n\n\nThe AllJoyn core library calls the registered signal \nhandler for the signal passing the received signal message parameters. \n\n\n\n\nData exchange via property\n\n\nThe provider and consumer apps can exchange data via property \nmembers defined in the BusInterfaces of the service object. \nA property member has predefined get and set method calls \nto get the value of the property and to set a specific value \non the property. The consumer app can invoke these get and \nset method calls for the property to exchange data. \n\n\nTo invoke these property methods, the message flow detailed \nfor method calls in \nData exchange via methods\n applies.\n\n\nSignal versus (method call without reply)\n\n\nIt is good to understand the difference between a signal and \nmethod call without a reply. In both cases, a single message \nis sent from the source; however, these are quite different. \nOne of the main differences is that they are sent in different \ndirections. A SIGNAL message is emitted by the provider app, \nwhereas a METHOD_CALL message is sent by the consumer app. \nIn addition, a SIGNAL message can be sent to be received by \neither a single destination or by multiple destinations, \nwhereas the METHOD_CALL message is always sent to a single destination.\n\n\nMatch rules\n\n\nThe AllJoyn framework supports D-Bus match rules for the consumer \napplication to request and receive specific set of messages. \nMatch rules describe the messages that should be sent to a \nconsumer app based on the contents of the message. Match rules \nare typically used to receive a specific set of signal messages. \nConsumer apps can ask to receive specific set of signals from \nthe AllJoyn router by specifying filtering/matching rules for signals. \n\n\nSignals that are sent to a specific destination do not need \nto match the consumer's match rule. Instead, match rules are \napplied to signals which are not sent to a specific destination; \nthey are meant to be received by multiple endpoints. These \ninclude broadcast signals, sessionless signals and session-specific \nsignals sent to multiple participants in the session. \nSuch signals get forwarded to only those consumer applications \nthat have a suitable match rule. This avoids unnecessary waking \nup and processing for signals at the consumer applications.\n\n\nConsumer applications can add a match rule by using the AddMatch \nmethod exposed by the AllJoyn router. Match rules are specified \nas a string of comma-separated key/value pairs. Excluding a key \nfrom the rule indicates a wildcard match, e.g., excluding the \nmember key from a match rule but adding a sender lets all \nmessages from that sender through. \n\n\nFor example:\n\n\nMatch Rule = \n\ntype='signal',sender='org.freedesktop.DBus',interface='org.freedesktop.DBus',\nmember='Foo',path='/bar/foo',destination=':452345.34'\n\n\n\n\n\nThe AllJoyn framework supports a subset of D-Bus match rules \nas captured in \nMatch rule keys supported by the AllJoyn framework\n. \n\n\nNOTE:\n The AllJoyn does not support D-Bus specified arg[0,1...N], \narg[0,1,...N]path, arg0namespace and eavesdrop='true' in match rules.\n\n\nMatch rule keys supported by the AllJoyn framework\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nMatch key\n\n\nPossible values\n\n\nDescription\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\ntype\n\n\nsignal\nmethod_call\nmethod_return\nerror\n\n\nMatch on the message type. An example of a type match is type='signal'.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nsender\n\n\nA well-known name or unique name\n\n\nMatch messages sent by a particular sender. An example of a sender match is sender='org.alljoyn.Refrigerator'.\n\n\n\n\n\n\ninterface\n\n\nAn interface name\n\n\nMatch messages sent over or to a particular interface. An example of an interface match is interface='org.alljoyn.Refrigerator'. If a message omits the interface header, it must not match any rule that specifies this key.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nmember\n\n\nAny valid method or signal name\n\n\nMatches messages which have the give method or signal name. An example of a member match is member='NameOwnerChanged'.\n\n\n\n\n\n\npath\n\n\nAn object path\n\n\nMatches messages which are sent from or to the given object. An example of a path match is path='/org/alljoyn/Refrigerator'.\n\n\n\n\n\n\npath_namespace\n\n\nAn object path\n\n\nMatches messages which are sent from or to an object for which the object path is either the given value, or that value followed by one or more path components.\nFor example, path_namespace='/com/example/foo' would match signals sent by /com/example/foo or by /com/example/foo/bar, but not by /com/example/foobar.\nUsing both path and path_namespace in the same match rule is not allowed.\n\n\n\n\n\n\ndestination\n\n\nA unique name\n\n\nMatches messages which are being sent to the given unique name. An example of a destination match is destination=':100.2'.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAn application can add multiple match rules for signals with the \nAllJoyn router. In this case, the app is essentially requesting \nto get signal messages based on multiple filtering criteria, and \nall match rules are applicable. As a result, the signal messages \nget sent to the app if they matches any of the specified match rules. \n\n\nThe AllJoyn router sends a union of messages to the app that \nmatches with the specified rules. For example, if there is a \nmore restrictive rule that matches a small set of signals, \nand there is another less restrictive rule that matches a \nlarger superset of signals, the AllJoyn router always sends \nthe larger superset of signals to the app.\n\n\nType system\n\n\nThe AllJoyn framework uses the D-Bus protocol type system \nwhich allows values of various types to be serialized in a \nstandard way into a sequence of bytes referred to as the \nwire format. Converting values from some other representation \ninto the wire format is called marshaling, and converting it \nback from the wire format is called unmarshaling. \n\n\nThe AllJoyn framework uses D-Bus marshaling format.\n\n\nType signatures\n\n\nThe AllJoyn framework uses the same type signatures that \nare used by the D-Bus protocol. The type signature is made \nup of type codes. The type code is an ASCII character that \nrepresents a standard data type. \n\n\nData types supported by the AllJoyn framework\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nConventional name\n\n\nCode\n\n\nASCII\n\n\nDescription\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nINVALID\n\n\n0\n\n\nNUL\n\n\nNot a valid type code, used to terminate signatures.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nBYTE\n\n\n121\n\n\n'y'\n\n\n8-bit unsigned integer.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nBOOLEAN\n\n\n98\n\n\n'b'\n\n\nBoolean value, 0 is FALSE and 1 is TRUE.

The AllJoyn message format is used \nto send messages between AllJoyn routers as well as between \nthe application and the AllJoyn router.\n\n\nMethod calls, method replies and signal messages get encapsulated \nin AllJoyn message format. D-Bus defined METHOD_CALL, METHOD_RETURN \nand SIGNAL messages are used (with AllJoyn enhancements) for \ntransporting these messages respectively. In case of error \nscenarios, an ERROR message is returned in reply to a method \ncall (instead of METHOD_RETURN). \n\n\nAn AllJoyn message consists of a header and a body. \nThe following figure shows the AllJoyn message format. \nDefinitions for each message format field are provided in subsequent tables.\n\n\n\n\nFigure:\n AllJoyn message format\n\n\nMessage format fields supported by the AllJoyn framework\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nField name\n\n\nDescription\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nEndianness Flag\n\n\nEndianness of the message.

A session \nID-based routing table is formed and maintained at the AllJoyn \nrouter for routing messages. A single routing table is maintained \nfor all the active sessions. \n\n\nConceptually, for every session ID, the routing table maintains \na list of destination app endpoints for every app participating \nin the session and next hop bus-to-bus endpoint for those app \nendpoints which are remote. A remote endpoint is attached to \na different AllJoyn router; however, it can be on the same \ndevice or on a different device. For destination endpoints that \nare local to the AllJoyn router, no bus-to-bus endpoint is \nmaintained in the routing table.\n\n\nAllJoyn routing table = List (session Id, List (destination app endpoint, \nnext hop B2B endpoint))\n\n\n\n\nNOTE:\n A given destination endpoint can appear multiple times \nas part of different sessionId entries in an AllJoyn routing \ntable. In this case, if there are multiple possible paths to a \nremote destination, different bus-to-bus endpoints can be used \nfor the same destination as part of different sessionId entries. \n\n\nWhen selecting a route, sessionId is used first to find a \nmatching entry in the routing table. Destination field is used \nnext to select a bus-to-bus endpoint (for remote destinations). \n\n\nThe following figure shows a deployment with two devices having \nan AllJoyn session established between them. All four apps \nare part of the session.\n\n\n\n\nFigure:\n AllJoyn routing example\n\n\nThe AllJoyn router on each of the device maintains a routing \ntable. \nSample routing table on provider device\n and\n[Sample routing table on consumer device][sample-routing-table-on-consumer-device] show sample\nAllJoyn routing tables maintained on the provider and consumer \nAllJoyn routers, respectively.\n\n\nSample routing table on provider device\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSession ID\n\n\nDestination (app endpoint)\n\n\nNext hop (B2B endpoint)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n10\n\n\nApp1 Endpoint (:100.2)\n\n\nN/A\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nApp 2 Endpoint (:100.3)\n\n\nN/A\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nApp 3 Endpoint (:200.2)\n\n\nB2B Endpoint (:100.4)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nApp 4 Endpoint (:200.3)\n\n\nB2B Endpoint (:100.4)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSample routing table on consumer device\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSession ID\n\n\nDestination (app endpoint)\n\n\nNext hop (B2B endpoint)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n10\n\n\nApp1 Endpoint (:100.2)\n\n\nB2B Endpoint (:100.4)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nApp 2 Endpoint (:100.3)\n\n\nB2B Endpoint (:100.4)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nApp 3 Endpoint (:200.2)\n\n\nN/A\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nApp 4 Endpoint (:200.3)\n\n\nN/A\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nRouting table formation\n\n\nRouting tables are formed based on the bus-to-bus endpoint \ninformation included in the AttachSession method call. When \nan AllJoyn router receives an AttachSession call, it can be \nfrom an app trying to form a new session or from a new member \nbeing added to an existing session. \n\n\n\n\nAttachSession for a new session: In this case, the AllJoyn \nrouter sends an Accept session to the app. (Currently, the \nsingle-hop use case is captured.)  If the session is accepted, \nit creates a new sessionId. It then adds an entry for that \nsessionId in the routing table with the two participants \nas destinations and bus-to-bus endpoint received in the AttachSession \nas next hop for the remote app endpoint.\n\n\nAttachSession from an added member: In this case, the session \nis a multi-point session and the AllJoyn router already has an \nentry for the associated sessionId in the routing table. \nThe member from where the AttachSession is received gets added \nas a new destination with the bus-to-bus endpoint in the \nAttachSession as next hop.\n\n\n\n\nRouting logic\n\n\nAs described above, the sessionId from the message (if present) \nis used first to find a matching sessionId entry in the routing \ntable. Next, the destination field (if present) is used to find \na matching destination entry to perform the routing. \n\n\nThe following sections capture the routing logic for different use cases.\n\n\nRouting based on sessionId and destination field\n\n\nIf an app-directed message has a non-zero sessionId as well \nas destination fields, the AllJoyn router first finds that \nsessionId entry in the routing table and then finds the \ndestination entry within that sessionId for the message destination. \n\n\n\n\nIf the destination was a remote endpoint, then the message gets \nsent to the bus-to-bus endpoint specified for that destination in \nthe routing table. \n\n\nIf the destination is locally attached to the AllJoyn router, \nthe message gets directly sent over the local bus connection to \nthat destination.\n\n\n\n\nRouting based on sessionId field only\n\n\nIf an app-directed message only has a sessionId but no destination \nfield, the message gets forwarded to all the destination endpoints \nin that session. The AllJoyn router finds the matching sessionId \nentry in the routing table and send the message to all the destinations \nlisted for that session, except the one which sent the message. \n\n For remote app endpoints in the session, the message gets \nforwarded to associated bus-to-bus endpoint from the routing table. \n\n For locally attached app endpoints in the session, the AllJoyn \nrouter directly forwards message to those app endpoints over \nthe local bus connection. \n\n\nRouting for sessionId=0\n\n\nAn app-directed message can specify a sessionId=0 or, if no \nsessionId field is included, the AllJoyn router assumes sessionId \nto be 0. The sessionId field value can be zero for any message type. \nFor METHOD_CALL, METHOD_RETURN and ERROR messages, the only \nrequirement is that the destination field must be specified.  \n\n\nFor messages with sessionId=0 (or no specified sessionId), \nif a destination field is specified, the AllJoyn router selects \nany available route from the routing table (from any of the \nsession entry containing that destination) and forwards the \nmessage over the bus-to-bus endpoint for that route.\n\n\nFor SIGNAL messages with sessionId=0 (or no specified sessionId), \nthe destination field does not need to be present. In this case, \nthe AllJoyn router looks at the GLOBAL_BROADCAST flag in the message \nto determine how that SIGNAL message should be routed per logic below: \n\n\n\n\nGLOBAL_BROADCAST Flag set: The SIGNAL message should be globally \nbroadcast to all connected endpoints over any session. The Destination \nfield is not looked at when routing such a signal message. The AllJoyn \nrouter sends this message to all destination endpoints from the \nrouting table across all sessionIds. \n\n\nFor remote destinations, the SIGNAL message gets forwarded to \nthe associated bus-to-bus endpoint. \n\n\nFor locally connected destination, the message gets forwarded \ndirectly to the app endpoint over local bus connection.\n\n\nGLOBAL_BROADCAST Flag not set: The SIGNAL message should be \nsent over all the locally attached app endpoints. The AllJoyn \nrouter forwards the message to all of the locally connected \napp endpoint over local bus connection.",

A METHOD_RETURN reply message \nis sent back to the consumer app.   Figure:  Data exchange via method calls (reply sent)  The message flow steps are described below.   Both the provider and consumer apps connect to the AllJoyn \nrouter and perform advertisement and discovery steps to \ndiscover desired services.  The provider app registers its service objects with the \nAllJoyn core library. This step is needed to expose service \nobjects to remote nodes on the network. The AllJoyn core library \nadds a MethodHandler for all the methods associated with a \ngiven service object.  The provider app binds a session port with the AllJoyn \nrouter via the AllJoyn core library's BindSessionPort API. \nThis call specifies a session port, session options and a \nSessionPortListener for the session.  The provider and consumer apps perform AllJoyn service \nadvertisement and discovery to discover the service offered \nby the provider app.  The consumer app establishes an AllJoyn session with the \nprovider app over the bound session port. Now there is a \nsession connection established between provider and consumer \napp to exchange data.  The consumer app creates a proxyBusObect via the AllJoyn \ncore library's GetProxyBusObjcet API. The app specifies unique \nname of provider app, object path for the service object, \nsessionId, and list of BusInterfaces to which the proxy \nobject should respond.  The consumer app gets the BusInterface from the created \nproxy object and calls a method on this BusInterface. \nThe app provides input parameters for the method.  The ProxyBusObject:MethodCall method is called, which \ngenerates an AllJoyn METHOD_CALL message for the method call.  The proxy object sends the generated METHOD_CALL message \nto the AllJoyn router.  The AllJoyn router receives the message and determines \nwhere this message needs to be routed based on the \nsession ID/destination information included in the message. \nIn this case, the message needs to be routed to remote \nAllJoyn router endpoint at the provider.  The AllJoyn router sends the METHOD_CALL message to the \nremote AllJoyn router over the established session connection. \nThe METHOD_CALL message includes a serial number, service \nobjectPath, interfaceName in the service object, member name \n(method name) within the interfaceName, sessionId, and sender \nunique name as part of the header fields of the message. \nThe method input parameters are included as part of the message body.  The provider AllJoyn router receives the METHOD_CALL \nmessage. It determines where this message needs to be \nrouted based on the session ID/destination information. \nIn this case, the message needs to be routed to the AllJoyn \ncore library app endpoint.   The AllJoyn router sends the METHOD_CALL message to \nthe AllJoyn core library endpoint.   The AllJoyn core library invokes the registered MethodHandler \nfor the method call member specified in the received message. \nThe MethodHandler invokes the actual method call with the \nBusInterface of the service object and receives the method \nresponse. It generates a METHOD_RETURN message for the method \nreply and sends to the AllJoyn router.   The AllJoyn router receives the METHOD_RETURN message \nand determines where this message needs to be routed based \non session ID/destination information included in the message. \nIn this case, the message needs to be routed to the remote \nAllJoyn router endpoint at the consumer.  The provider AllJoyn router sends the METHOD_RETURN \n   message to the remote AllJoyn router over established \n   session connection. The METHOD_RETURN message includes a \n   reply serial number (serial number of the associated METHOD_CALL \n   message), sessionId, and sender's unique name as part of \n   message header fields.  Any output parameters for the \n   METHOD_RETURN message is specified as part of the message body.  The consumer AllJoyn router receives the METHOD_RETURN \n  message. It determines where this message needs to be routed \n  based on the session ID/destination information. In this case, \n  the message needs to be routed to the app endpoint.  The AllJoyn router sends the METHOD_RETURN message to the \n  application's endpoint with output parameters as the response \n  to the original METHOD_CALL message. If the METHOD_CALL message \n  was sent asynchronously, a ReplyHandler gets registered which \n  is invoked when the METHOD_RETURN message is received.   Provider app not sending a reply  When defining an interface definition, the provider can annotate \nsome methods that are not returning any output parameters as \nNO_REPLY_EXPECTED. For such methods, the provider app will not \nbe sending any METHOD_RETURN message back to the consumer. \nWhen invoking such a method, the consumer should set the NO_REPLY_EXPECTED \nflag to indicate to the AllJoyn core library that it does \nnot need to start a timer and wait for a reply from the provider.  The following figure shows the message flow for the scenario \nwhen a method is invoked with the NO_REPLY_EXPECTED flag set, \nand no reply is sent by the provider app.   Figure:  Data exchange via method calls (reply not sent)  Most of the message flow steps are similar to the reply sent \nmessage flow returning a method reply. The following captures \nthe distinguishing steps with respect to that flow.   When defining a service interface, provider app annotates \none or more methods in the interface as NO_REPLY_EXPECTED. \nThe service object implementing the service interface gets \nregistered with the AllJoyn core library.  On the consumer side, when that method call is invoked \nvia ProxyObject interfaces, the consumer sets the NO_REPLY_EXPECTED \nflag. This indicates to the AllJoyn core library that it does \nnot need to start a timer and wait for a reply from the provider.  The METHOD_CALL message reaches the provider app and the \nassociated method gets invoked. Since the method was annotated \nwith NO_REPLY_EXPECTED, the provider app does not generate any reply.",

            "text": "The AllJoyn framework supports D-Bus match rules for the consumer \napplication to request and receive specific set of messages. \nMatch rules describe the messages that should be sent to a \nconsumer app based on the contents of the message. Match rules \nare typically used to receive a specific set of signal messages. \nConsumer apps can ask to receive specific set of signals from \nthe AllJoyn router by specifying filtering/matching rules for signals.   Signals that are sent to a specific destination do not need \nto match the consumer's match rule. Instead, match rules are \napplied to signals which are not sent to a specific destination; \nthey are meant to be received by multiple endpoints. These \ninclude broadcast signals, sessionless signals and session-specific \nsignals sent to multiple participants in the session. \nSuch signals get forwarded to only those consumer applications \nthat have a suitable match rule. This avoids unnecessary waking \nup and processing for signals at the consumer applications.  Consumer applications can add a match rule by using the AddMatch \nmethod exposed by the AllJoyn router. Match rules are specified \nas a string of comma-separated key/value pairs. Excluding a key \nfrom the rule indicates a wildcard match, e.g., excluding the \nmember key from a match rule but adding a sender lets all \nmessages from that sender through.   For example:  Match Rule =  type='signal',sender='org.freedesktop.DBus',interface='org.freedesktop.DBus',\nmember='Foo',path='/bar/foo',destination=':452345.34'   The AllJoyn framework supports a subset of D-Bus match rules \nas captured in  Match rule keys supported by the AllJoyn framework .   NOTE:  The AllJoyn does not support D-Bus specified arg[0,1...N], \narg[0,1,...N]path, arg0namespace and eavesdrop='true' in match rules.  Match rule keys supported by the AllJoyn framework     Match key  Possible values  Description      type  signal method_call method_return error  Match on the message type. An example of a type match is type='signal'.    sender  A well-known name or unique name  Match messages sent by a particular sender. An example of a sender match is sender='org.alljoyn.Refrigerator'.    interface  An interface name  Match messages sent over or to a particular interface. An example of an interface match is interface='org.alljoyn.Refrigerator'. If a message omits the interface header, it must not match any rule that specifies this key.    member  Any valid method or signal name  Matches messages which have the give method or signal name. An example of a member match is member='NameOwnerChanged'.    path  An object path  Matches messages which are sent from or to the given object. An example of a path match is path='/org/alljoyn/Refrigerator'.    path_namespace  An object path  Matches messages which are sent from or to an object for which the object path is either the given value, or that value followed by one or more path components. For example, path_namespace='/com/example/foo' would match signals sent by /com/example/foo or by /com/example/foo/bar, but not by /com/example/foobar. Using both path and path_namespace in the same match rule is not allowed.    destination  A unique name  Matches messages which are being sent to the given unique name. An example of a destination match is destination=':100.2'.     An application can add multiple match rules for signals with the \nAllJoyn router. In this case, the app is essentially requesting \nto get signal messages based on multiple filtering criteria, and \nall match rules are applicable. As a result, the signal messages \nget sent to the app if they matches any of the specified match rules.   The AllJoyn router sends a union of messages to the app that \nmatches with the specified rules. For example, if there is a \nmore restrictive rule that matches a small set of signals, \nand there is another less restrictive rule that matches a \nlarger superset of signals, the AllJoyn router always sends \nthe larger superset of signals to the app.",

            "text": "The AllJoyn system supports routing logic to route the following \ncategories of messages:   App-specific messages: These are app-generated messages that \nget routed between app endpoints based on the session ID/destination \nbased routing logic described in section 6.9.1.  Control messages: These messages are generated by the AllJoyn \nrouter (e.g., AttachSession) that get routed to the local endpoint \nof the AllJoyn router.   Session ID/destination-based routing  The AllJoyn system supports message routing based on session ID \nand/or destination fields for app-specific messages. A session \nID-based routing table is formed and maintained at the AllJoyn \nrouter for routing messages. A single routing table is maintained \nfor all the active sessions.   Conceptually, for every session ID, the routing table maintains \na list of destination app endpoints for every app participating \nin the session and next hop bus-to-bus endpoint for those app \nendpoints which are remote. A remote endpoint is attached to \na different AllJoyn router; however, it can be on the same \ndevice or on a different device. For destination endpoints that \nare local to the AllJoyn router, no bus-to-bus endpoint is \nmaintained in the routing table.  AllJoyn routing table = List (session Id, List (destination app endpoint, \nnext hop B2B endpoint))  NOTE:  A given destination endpoint can appear multiple times \nas part of different sessionId entries in an AllJoyn routing \ntable. In this case, if there are multiple possible paths to a \nremote destination, different bus-to-bus endpoints can be used \nfor the same destination as part of different sessionId entries.   When selecting a route, sessionId is used first to find a \nmatching entry in the routing table. Destination field is used \nnext to select a bus-to-bus endpoint (for remote destinations).   The following figure shows a deployment with two devices having \nan AllJoyn session established between them. All four apps \nare part of the session.   Figure:  AllJoyn routing example  The AllJoyn router on each of the device maintains a routing \ntable.  Sample routing table on provider device  and\n[Sample routing table on consumer device][sample-routing-table-on-consumer-device] show sample\nAllJoyn routing tables maintained on the provider and consumer \nAllJoyn routers, respectively.  Sample routing table on provider device     Session ID  Destination (app endpoint)  Next hop (B2B endpoint)      10  App1 Endpoint (:100.2)  N/A     App 2 Endpoint (:100.3)  N/A     App 3 Endpoint (:200.2)  B2B Endpoint (:100.4)     App 4 Endpoint (:200.3)  B2B Endpoint (:100.4)     Sample routing table on consumer device     Session ID  Destination (app endpoint)  Next hop (B2B endpoint)      10  App1 Endpoint (:100.2)  B2B Endpoint (:100.4)     App 2 Endpoint (:100.3)  B2B Endpoint (:100.4)     App 3 Endpoint (:200.2)  N/A     App 4 Endpoint (:200.3)  N/A     Routing table formation  Routing tables are formed based on the bus-to-bus endpoint \ninformation included in the AttachSession method call. When \nan AllJoyn router receives an AttachSession call, it can be \nfrom an app trying to form a new session or from a new member \nbeing added to an existing session.    AttachSession for a new session: In this case, the AllJoyn \nrouter sends an Accept session to the app. (Currently, the \nsingle-hop use case is captured.)  If the session is accepted, \nit creates a new sessionId. It then adds an entry for that \nsessionId in the routing table with the two participants \nas destinations and bus-to-bus endpoint received in the AttachSession \nas next hop for the remote app endpoint.  AttachSession from an added member: In this case, the session \nis a multi-point session and the AllJoyn router already has an \nentry for the associated sessionId in the routing table. \nThe member from where the AttachSession is received gets added \nas a new destination with the bus-to-bus endpoint in the \nAttachSession as next hop.   Routing logic  As described above, the sessionId from the message (if present) \nis used first to find a matching sessionId entry in the routing \ntable. Next, the destination field (if present) is used to find \na matching destination entry to perform the routing.   The following sections capture the routing logic for different use cases.  Routing based on sessionId and destination field  If an app-directed message has a non-zero sessionId as well \nas destination fields, the AllJoyn router first finds that \nsessionId entry in the routing table and then finds the \ndestination entry within that sessionId for the message destination.    If the destination was a remote endpoint, then the message gets \nsent to the bus-to-bus endpoint specified for that destination in \nthe routing table.   If the destination is locally attached to the AllJoyn router, \nthe message gets directly sent over the local bus connection to \nthat destination.   Routing based on sessionId field only  If an app-directed message only has a sessionId but no destination \nfield, the message gets forwarded to all the destination endpoints \nin that session. The AllJoyn router finds the matching sessionId \nentry in the routing table and send the message to all the destinations \nlisted for that session, except the one which sent the message.   For remote app endpoints in the session, the message gets \nforwarded to associated bus-to-bus endpoint from the routing table.   For locally attached app endpoints in the session, the AllJoyn \nrouter directly forwards message to those app endpoints over \nthe local bus connection.   Routing for sessionId=0  An app-directed message can specify a sessionId=0 or, if no \nsessionId field is included, the AllJoyn router assumes sessionId \nto be 0. The sessionId field value can be zero for any message type. \nFor METHOD_CALL, METHOD_RETURN and ERROR messages, the only \nrequirement is that the destination field must be specified.    For messages with sessionId=0 (or no specified sessionId), \nif a destination field is specified, the AllJoyn router selects \nany available route from the routing table (from any of the \nsession entry containing that destination) and forwards the \nmessage over the bus-to-bus endpoint for that route.  For SIGNAL messages with sessionId=0 (or no specified sessionId), \nthe destination field does not need to be present. In this case, \nthe AllJoyn router looks at the GLOBAL_BROADCAST flag in the message \nto determine how that SIGNAL message should be routed per logic below:    GLOBAL_BROADCAST Flag set: The SIGNAL message should be globally \nbroadcast to all connected endpoints over any session. The Destination \nfield is not looked at when routing such a signal message. The AllJoyn \nrouter sends this message to all destination endpoints from the \nrouting table across all sessionIds.   For remote destinations, the SIGNAL message gets forwarded to \nthe associated bus-to-bus endpoint.   For locally connected destination, the message gets forwarded \ndirectly to the app endpoint over local bus connection.  GLOBAL_BROADCAST Flag not set: The SIGNAL message should be \nsent over all the locally attached app endpoints. The AllJoyn \nrouter forwards the message to all of the locally connected \napp endpoint over local bus connection.",

Examples of Services include support for \ndevice-specific features (such as the power setting on a \nmicrowave or the input source on a TV), or bridges that \nprovide backwards and lateral compatibility support for \nprotocols like DLNA.\n\n\nProject\n\n\nA Project is the organizational unit that produces one or \nmore Services that perform a specific function within the \ncontext of the AllSeen Alliance. Its use cases should be narrowly \nscoped, and it should do those things well. Projects operate \nwithin the open source model as defined by the Alliance, and \nare overseen by one or more Committers. Each Project must \nbelong to only one Working Group.\n\n\nWorking Group\n\n\nA Working Group is logical grouping of one or more Projects. \nThe Working Group is a meritocratic organization that follows \nopen source best practices to produce code within the scope of \nthe policy as set by the Technical Steering Committee and the \nBoard. Project Committers make decisions within the Working \nGroup, and elect the Working Group Chair as a leader and to \nrepresent the Working Group on the Technical Steering Committee.\n\n\nOverview\n\n\nProjects are the most fundamental units of organization within \nthe AllSeen Alliance. They are code-driven, meritocratic open source\nprojects that produce features and functionality within the \nscope of the policy as set by the Technical Steering Committee\nand the board.\n\n\nEach Project should be as narrowly scoped as is reasonable, to \nallow contributors to focus upon doing a few things very well.\nThere should be at least one Committer per Project, to ensure \nthat the person or persons responsible for applying code into \nthe mainline repository is familiar with the codebase.\n\n\nWorking Groups are logical groupings of Projects that have \nachieved Mature status. In the simplest situation, a newly \ncreated Project would be its own Working Group. In the case \nthat multiple related Projects are created, they may be grouped \ninto the same Working Group. If a Working Group no longer \ncontains any Mature Projects, it will be removed.\n\n\nEach Working Group is comprised of the Contributors and Committers \nof its Projects. The Committers in the Working Group will, from \ntime to time, elect a single leader called the Working Group \nChair. The Working Group Chair is responsible for overseeing \nthe activities of the Working Group, and represents the Working \nGroup and its Projects on the Technical Steering Committee.\n\n\nProject Types and Lifecycle\n\n\nProject States\n\n\nThe valid states of Projects are:\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nProject Stages\n\n\nDescription\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nProposal\n\n\nDoesn't really exist yet, has no real\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nresources, but is expected to be created\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\ndue to a specific need.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nIncubation\n\n\nProject has resources, but is recognized\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nto be in the early stages and is not yet\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\ncontributing product-ready code.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nMature\n\n\nProject is a fully functioning, successful\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nopen source project that has been assigned\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nto a Working Group\n\n\n\n\n\n\nArchived\n\n\nProject has been recognized as dead, and\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nhas been archived as it's no longer a going\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nconcern.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nProject State Transitions\n\n\nThe valid transitions (and their associated reviews) are:\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFrom State\n\n\nTo State\n\n\nReview\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nnull\n\n\nProposal\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nProposal\n\n\nIncubation\n\n\nCreation Review\n\n\n\n\n\n\nIncubation\n\n\nMature\n\n\nGraduation Review\n\n\n\n\n\n\n{Proposal, Incubation, Mature}\n\n\nArchived\n\n\nTermination Review\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nReview processes\n\n\nFor each review, there will be a publicly visible wiki/web \ntemplate filled out containing the relevant review information, \nas outlined in the sections below.\n\n\nThe review document must be posted and announced for public \nomment for at least 2 weeks prior to the date the review is\nscheduled, to give participants sufficient time to decide.\n\n\nReviews ideally should be conducted in a manner that is sensitive \nto the global nature of the community (i.e., the geography and \ntime zone dispersion).\n\n\nReviews may in some circumstances be combined (for example a \ncreation and graduation review for a Project seeking to come \ninto the Alliance that is already mature in its previous venue).\nIf reviews are combined, the review document need only be posted \nfor a single 2 week review period.\n\n\nCreation review process and criteria\n\n\n\n\nProposal posted for 2 weeks of review. \n     \nProposal template\n \n     a.

These initial \nProjects will come in at various levels of maturity. In order \nto sort these Projects into the most appropriate Lifecycle state \nand Working Groups in a way that is clear, consistent, and fair:\n\n\n\n\nPrior to a date to be decided by the TSC in its first \n     meeting not less than 1 month and not more than 6 months \n     after the Alliance launches, a Project may decide to either\n     a. Seek entry in \u2018bootstrap\u2019 state (explained more below)\n     b. Seek entry via the steady state Project Lifecycle (ie,\n        propose for Incubation)\n\n\nIf a Project enters is in \u2018bootstrap\u2019 state, at the first\n     meeting of the official (post-formation) TSC after it \n     petitions to exit bootstrap state, the TSC will decide \n     the proper Project Lifecycle state and Working Group for \n     the Project based on criteria rooted in the steady state \n     Project Lifecycle.\n\n\nOnce in a non-bootstrap state, a Project follows the \n    steady state Project Lifecycle.",

Its use cases should be narrowly \nscoped, and it should do those things well. Projects operate \nwithin the open source model as defined by the Alliance, and \nare overseen by one or more Committers. Each Project must \nbelong to only one Working Group.  Working Group  A Working Group is logical grouping of one or more Projects. \nThe Working Group is a meritocratic organization that follows \nopen source best practices to produce code within the scope of \nthe policy as set by the Technical Steering Committee and the \nBoard. Project Committers make decisions within the Working \nGroup, and elect the Working Group Chair as a leader and to \nrepresent the Working Group on the Technical Steering Committee.",

Working Groups are logical groupings of Projects that have \nachieved Mature status. In the simplest situation, a newly \ncreated Project would be its own Working Group. In the case \nthat multiple related Projects are created, they may be grouped \ninto the same Working Group. If a Working Group no longer \ncontains any Mature Projects, it will be removed.
